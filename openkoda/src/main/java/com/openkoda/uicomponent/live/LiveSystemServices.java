/**
 * Non-cloud implementation of {@link SystemServices} providing unrestricted server-side JavaScript
 * execution and system command execution capabilities for local and development environments.
 * <p>
 * This implementation is active when the "cloud" profile is NOT active (configured via
 * {@code @Profile("!cloud")}), making it suitable for local development and testing environments
 * where unrestricted access to system resources is acceptable.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * LiveSystemServices delegates JavaScript execution to {@link ServerJSRunner} for evaluating
 * ServerJS scripts and to {@link ServerJSProcessRunner} for executing operating system commands.
 * All command execution methods provide direct access to system shell commands without restrictions.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>SECURITY WARNING:</b> This implementation allows unrestricted command execution and is intended
 * ONLY for local development and non-production environments. For production and cloud deployments,
 * use {@code SecureLiveSystemServices} which provides appropriate security restrictions.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Thread-Safety: This class is stateless and thread-safe, delegating to thread-safe service components.
 * </p>
