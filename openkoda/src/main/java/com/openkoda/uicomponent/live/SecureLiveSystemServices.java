/**
 * Production-safe implementation of {@link SystemServices} interface for cloud/production environments.
 * <p>
 * This implementation is active when the "cloud" Spring profile is enabled and provides security-hardened
 * implementations of system service methods. Unlike {@link LiveSystemServices}, this class restricts or
 * disables all command execution and server-side code execution capabilities to prevent arbitrary code
 * execution in production environments.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * All command execution methods ({@link #runCommandToStream(String)}, {@link #runCommandToString(String)},
 * {@link #runCommandToByteArray(String)}) return safe default values (null, empty string, or nullInputStream)
 * rather than executing system commands. The {@link #runServerSideCode(String, Map, List)} method also
 * returns null to prevent dynamic code execution.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <strong>SECURITY NOTE:</strong> This implementation is designed for cloud and production deployments where
 * arbitrary command and code execution poses significant security risks. For development and local environments
 * with full command execution capabilities, use {@link LiveSystemServices} with appropriate profiles.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This class is stateless and thread-safe. All operations are no-ops for production safety.
 * </p>
