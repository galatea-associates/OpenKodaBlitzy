/**
 * Service contract for email delivery and WebSocket-based real-time messaging.
 * <p>
 * Provides overloaded sendEmail methods for immediate and scheduled delivery with plain text
 * or templated content using Thymeleaf templates. Supports file attachments for emails.
 * Offers WebSocket message delivery to specific users or broadcast channels for real-time
 * communication. All email operations create Email entity records for tracking and audit purposes.
 * All methods are annotated with {@link Autocomplete} for UI tooling metadata.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Implementation: LiveMessagesServices provides the concrete implementation of this interface,
 * delegating to EmailService for email operations and WebsocketService for WebSocket messaging.
 * </p>
