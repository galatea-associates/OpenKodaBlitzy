/**
 * Marker interface for preview mode component provider registration and dependency injection.
 * <p>
 * Empty interface used for type-based Spring bean selection and autowiring. Implementations provide
 * restricted service access during development/preview mode. Used by JsFlowRunner.runPreviewFlow to
 * inject preview-mode services instead of live services.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Enables safe flow preview execution without side effects (no actual emails sent, no database writes).
 * Spring @Autowired(required=false) allows graceful degradation when preview mode not configured.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Use case: Form designers can preview JavaScript flows without triggering real email sends or external API calls.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note: No methods defined - purely for type identification and DI selection.
 * </p>
 *
 * @author OpenKoda Team
 * @version 1.7.1
 * @since 1.7.1
