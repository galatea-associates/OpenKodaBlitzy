/**
 * Data Transfer Object for invoice metadata and billing details used in payment processing.
 * <p>
 * This class implements {@link CanonicalObject} and {@link OrganizationRelatedObject} contracts
 * to provide standardized notification messaging and multi-tenant organization association.
 * It represents a mutable POJO design optimized for mapping and serialization between
 * payment service layers and external billing systems.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The class uses {@link BigDecimal} for monetary values (value and tax fields) to ensure
 * precision in financial calculations without floating-point rounding errors.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Example usage:
 * <pre>{@code
 * InvoiceDto invoice = new InvoiceDto();
 * invoice.setInvoiceIdentifier("INV-2024-001");
 * invoice.setBuyerCompanyName("Acme Corp");
 * invoice.setValue(new BigDecimal("1500.00"));
