/**
 * Simple Data Transfer Object (DTO) that carries global organization role names.
 * <p>
 * This DTO is used for role assignment and authorization workflows where role
 * information needs to be transferred between application layers. It provides
 * a mutable container for a list of role name strings.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note: This class follows a mutable design pattern with direct list access.
 * The getter returns a live list (not a defensive copy), allowing callers to
 * modify the list directly. This design prioritizes simplicity and performance
 * over immutability for internal data transfer scenarios.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Example usage:
 * <pre>{@code
 * GlobalOrgRoleDto dto = new GlobalOrgRoleDto();
 * dto.getGlobalOrganizationRoles().add("ROLE_ADMIN");
 * dto.getGlobalOrganizationRoles().add("ROLE_USER");
 * }</pre>
 * </p>
