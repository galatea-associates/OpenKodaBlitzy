/**
 * Multi-tenancy marker interface for organization-scoped data transfer objects.
 * <p>
 * This interface identifies DTOs that belong to a specific organization (tenant) in the
 * multi-tenant OpenKoda system. The organization ID serves as the primary mechanism for
 * tenant isolation and data routing, ensuring that operations are performed within the
 * correct organizational boundary.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Objects implementing this interface can be either organization-scoped (non-null organization ID)
 * or global (null organization ID). Global objects are accessible across all tenants and
 * represent system-wide data such as global roles, system configurations, or shared resources.
 * Organization-scoped objects are isolated to their respective tenant and implement proper
 * data segregation.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Typical implementing classes include organization-scoped DTOs for notifications, files,
 * system settings, and user-related data transfer objects. Services, repositories, and
 * authorization code use this interface to determine the tenant context for operations,
 * apply privilege checks, and enforce multi-tenancy boundaries.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Example usage:
 * <pre>{@code
 * OrganizationRelatedObject dto = ...;
 * if (!dto.isGlobal()) {
 *     Long orgId = dto.getOrganizationId();
 *     // Apply organization-scoped operations
 * }
 * }</pre>
 * </p>
