 * Organization data transfer object for multi-tenant routing and branding customization.

 * This DTO carries organization/tenant information used throughout the application for
 * tenant identification, database routing, and UI branding. It implements
 * {@link CanonicalObject} for standardized notification message formatting and
 * {@link OrganizationRelatedObject} for multi-tenant contract support.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * OrganizationDto is used by organization services for tenant provisioning,
 * by tenant resolution mechanisms for routing requests to the correct datasource,
 * and by UI customization services for applying organization-specific branding.
 * The DTO includes branding fields for visual customization (colors, logo) and
 * feature flags for trial setup and dashboard personalization.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Example usage:
 * <pre>
 * OrganizationDto dto = new OrganizationDto(organization);
 * String brandColor = dto.getMainBrandColor();
 * </pre>
