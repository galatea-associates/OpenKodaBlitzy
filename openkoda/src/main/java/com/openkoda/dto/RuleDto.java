/**
 * Data Transfer Object for rule engine configuration with if-then-else logic.
 * <p>
 * This DTO represents business rules and conditional workflows used by the rule editor UI.
 * It structures rule definitions using nested maps where the outer map is keyed by sequence
 * numbers (Long) and the inner map is keyed by {@link StatementKey} enum values.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The rule structure consists of three statement types:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>ifStatements</b> - Condition statements that are evaluated</li>
 *   <li><b>thenStatements</b> - Action statements executed when conditions are true</li>
 *   <li><b>elseStatements</b> - Action statements executed when conditions are false</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Usage context: This DTO is used by rule services, form builders, and decision engines
 * to represent and transport rule configurations between layers of the application.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Implementation uses {@link TreeMap} to ensure ordered iteration by sequence key,
 * which is important for maintaining the logical order of rule statements.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note: Contains TODO comments regarding Rule 5.5 design principle that DTOs should
 * not contain logic code. The {@link #allValues()} and {@link #splitValues(Map)} methods
 * may need to be refactored to a separate service class in future versions.
 * </p>
