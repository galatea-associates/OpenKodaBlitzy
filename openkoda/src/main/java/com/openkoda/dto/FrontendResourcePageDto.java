/**
 * Specialized subtype of FrontendResourceDto for page-scoped frontend resources.
 * <p>
 * This class serves as a marker type with no additional fields or behavior beyond
 * what is inherited from FrontendResourceDto. It enables type differentiation in CMS
 * and frontend resource management systems, allowing controllers and services to
 * distinguish page resources from other resource types such as snippets or templates.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The type distinction is useful for routing, filtering, and applying page-specific
 * business rules without adding runtime overhead or additional data fields.
 * </p>
