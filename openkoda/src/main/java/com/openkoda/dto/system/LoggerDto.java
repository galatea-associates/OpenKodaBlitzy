/**
 * Data Transfer Object for configuring logging system parameters including buffer size and class-specific logging.
 * <p>
 * This DTO implements {@link CanonicalObject} to provide notification messages for audit trails and system monitoring.
 * It is designed as a mutable JavaBean without validation, equals/hashCode implementations, or thread-safety guarantees.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The DTO is used by logging configuration services, admin controllers, and system setup components to manage
 * runtime logging behavior. It supports configuring a logging buffer size (parsed from string to integer) and
 * specifying a set of fully-qualified class names for which detailed logging should be enabled.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <strong>Important Notes:</strong>
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>This class has a mutable design without validation - external validation is required before use</li>
 * <li>{@link #getBufferSize()} will throw {@link NumberFormatException} if {@code bufferSizeField} is not a valid integer or is null</li>
 * <li>{@link #notificationMessage()} will throw {@link NullPointerException} if {@code loggingClasses} is null</li>
 * <li>The fluent setter pattern in {@link #setLoggingClasses(Set)} violates Rule 5.4 (DTOs should not have state-changing methods)</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Example usage:
 * <pre>{@code
 * LoggerDto dto = new LoggerDto();
 * dto.setBufferSize(1024);
 * dto.setLoggingClasses(Set.of("com.openkoda.service.UserService"));
 * }</pre>
 * </p>
