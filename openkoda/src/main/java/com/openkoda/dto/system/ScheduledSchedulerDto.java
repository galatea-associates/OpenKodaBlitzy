/**
 * Data transfer object that extends SchedulerDto to add scheduled execution time tracking for recurring jobs.
 * <p>
 * This DTO inherits CanonicalObject and OrganizationRelatedObject capabilities from its parent SchedulerDto,
 * providing multi-tenant job scheduling with execution timestamp tracking. The scheduledAt field captures when
 * a scheduled job was or will be executed, enabling execution tracking and audit trails.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This class follows a mutable design pattern without validation, equals/hashCode implementations, or thread-safety
 * guarantees. It is used by job schedulers, execution tracking systems, and audit systems to record and monitor
 * recurring job execution times. In distributed systems, careful handling of the timezone-naive LocalDateTime is required.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Example usage:
 * <pre>
 * ScheduledSchedulerDto dto = new ScheduledSchedulerDto("0 0 * * *", "{}", orgId, true, LocalDateTime.now());
 * </pre>
 * </p>
