/**
 * Base abstraction for all form definitions in OpenKoda, providing field-level privilege checking
 * and validation capabilities. This class serves as the foundation for request-side form adapters
 * that handle data transfer between entities and web forms with security enforcement.
 * <p>
 * Forms in OpenKoda follow a three-phase lifecycle:
 * </p>
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>Construction:</b> Form is created with a {@link FrontendMappingDefinition} that defines field metadata</li>
 *   <li><b>Privilege Evaluation:</b> Each field's read/write permissions are evaluated using {@link #canReadField} and {@link #canWriteField}</li>
 *   <li><b>Validation:</b> Form data is validated using {@link #validate} with Spring's BindingResult</li>
 *   <li><b>Rendering:</b> Form fields are rendered based on privilege checks stored in {@link #readWriteForField}</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * The {@link #readWriteForField} map maintains privilege state for each field, enabling the rendering
 * layer to show/hide fields based on user permissions. The map stores tuples where the first element
 * indicates read permission and the second indicates write permission for each field.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Example usage:
 * <pre>
 * FrontendMappingDefinition mapping = new FrontendMappingDefinition(fields);
 * MyForm form = new MyForm(mapping);
 * </pre>
 * </p>
