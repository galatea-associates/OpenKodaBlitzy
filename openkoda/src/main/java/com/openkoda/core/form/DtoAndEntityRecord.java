/**
 * Immutable record implementation of {@link DtoAndEntity} for passing DTO and entity pairs.
 * <p>
 * Provides a lightweight carrier for form processing pipelines where both the form DTO
 * representation and the persistent entity representation need to be passed together.
 * This record is commonly used in datalist suppliers and field converters where both
 * representations are needed to compute field values or populate dropdown options.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * As a Java 17 record, this class automatically provides:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Canonical constructor accepting dto and entity</li>
 *   <li>Public accessor methods: dto() and entity()</li>
 *   <li>Implementations of equals(), hashCode(), and toString()</li>
 *   <li>Immutability guarantees for the record components</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Example usage in form processing:
 * <pre>{@code
 * DtoAndEntityRecord<UserDto, User> record = new DtoAndEntityRecord<>(formDto, persistedEntity);
 * }</pre>
 * </p>
 *
 * @param <D> the DTO type used for form binding and display
 * @param <E> the entity type extending {@link LongIdEntity} for database persistence
 * @param dto the form DTO representation holding form field values
 * @param entity the persistent entity representation for database operations
 * @see DtoAndEntity
 * @see AbstractEntityForm
 * @see FrontendMappingFieldDefinition
 * @since 1.7.1
