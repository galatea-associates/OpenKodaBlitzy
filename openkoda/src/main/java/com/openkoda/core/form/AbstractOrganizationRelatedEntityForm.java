/**
 * Organization-scoped extension of {@link AbstractEntityForm} for tenant-aware entity binding.
 * <p>
 * This abstract form class provides multi-tenancy support by associating form instances with a specific
 * organization context. It extends the base entity form functionality with organization-scoped privilege
 * evaluation, ensuring that field read/write permissions are checked against both global and organization-specific
 * role assignments.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The form validates tenant consistency during construction by invoking {@code assertFormConsistency()},
 * which ensures the organization ID stored in the form matches the organization ID of the bound entity.
 * This validation prevents cross-tenant data leakage in multi-tenant deployments.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Example usage:
 * <pre>{@code
 * MyOrgForm form = new MyOrgForm(orgId, dto, entity, mapping);
 * form.populateFrom(entity);
 * if (form.validate()) {
 *     form.populateTo(entity);
 * }
 * }</pre>
 * </p>
 *
 * @param <C> the DTO type extending {@link OrganizationRelatedObject}, representing the data transfer object
 *            that carries organization context
 * @param <E> the entity type extending {@link OrganizationRelatedEntity}, representing the JPA entity
 *            that is scoped to an organization
