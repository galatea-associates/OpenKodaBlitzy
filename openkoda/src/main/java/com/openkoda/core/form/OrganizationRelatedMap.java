/**
 * HashMap-based DTO for organization-scoped dynamic entities.
 * <p>
 * Provides flexible key-value storage with organization awareness for handling
 * dynamic entities without predefined Java class structures. Extends HashMap
 * to support arbitrary field storage while implementing OrganizationRelatedObject
 * for multi-tenancy integration.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Used by MapEntityForm to handle MapEntity instances where field structure
 * is determined at runtime from FrontendMappingDefinition rather than static
 * JavaBean properties. The map stores field names as keys and field values
 * as objects, with special handling for the "organizationId" key to support
 * tenant-scoped operations.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Example usage:
 * <pre>{@code
 * OrganizationRelatedMap map = new OrganizationRelatedMap();
 * map.put("organizationId", 123L);
 * map.put("name", "Product Name");
 * map.put("price", 99.99);
 * Long orgId = map.getOrganizationId(); // Returns 123L
 * boolean isGlobal = map.isGlobal();    // Returns false
 * }</pre>
 * </p>
