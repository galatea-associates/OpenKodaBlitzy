/**
 * Request-scoped bean that holds unique correlation ID for HTTP request tracing.
 * <p>
 * Stores a unique web request ID generated at bean instantiation via {@link RequestIdHolder#generate()}.
 * The ID persists for the entire HTTP request lifecycle, enabling distributed tracing across controllers,
 * services, and repositories. Spring creates a new instance per HTTP request (via {@code @RequestScope})
 * and destroys it after response completion. Thread-safe as each request thread gets its own instance.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Bean Lifecycle:</b> Instantiated when first accessed during HTTP request processing, field
 * {@code webRequestId} initialized via {@link RequestIdHolder#generate()} in field initializer,
 * bean destroyed after HTTP response sent.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Integration:</b> Retrieved by {@link RequestIdHolder#getId()} when web request context exists.
 * Used by {@code LoggingComponentWithRequestId} for request correlation in log messages.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Example - Spring automatically injects per-request instance:
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * @Autowired
 * WebRequestIdHolder holder;
 * // Each HTTP request gets unique ID
 * String id = holder.getWebRequestId();
 * }
 * </pre>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> Not suitable for scheduled jobs or async tasks - use {@link RequestIdHolder#generate()}
 * directly for non-web contexts.
 * </p>
