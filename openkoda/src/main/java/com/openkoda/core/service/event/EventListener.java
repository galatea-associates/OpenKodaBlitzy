/**
 * Functional interface marking event handler methods and lambdas with domain-specific semantic meaning.
 * <p>
 * This interface extends {@link java.util.function.Consumer} to leverage JDK functional interface patterns,
 * enabling lambda expressions, method references, and functional composition. It serves as a semantic alias
 * for event consumer registration, providing type-safe event handling throughout the OpenKoda platform.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Key Benefits:</b>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Type-safe event handling with compile-time validation</li>
 *   <li>Lambda expression support for concise event handler definitions</li>
 *   <li>Method reference compatibility for existing handler methods</li>
 *   <li>Functional composition via {@code andThen()} for chaining handlers</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Integration Points:</b><br>
 * Event listeners are registered with {@link EventListenerService#registerEventConsumer} or
 * {@link ApplicationEventService#registerEventListener}. The ApplicationEventService dispatches
 * events asynchronously using a dedicated executor, requiring implementations to be thread-safe.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Thread Safety:</b><br>
 * Implementations must be thread-safe as listeners may be invoked concurrently by ApplicationEventService's
 * async executor. Shared mutable state should be properly synchronized or avoided.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Exception Handling:</b><br>
 * Uncaught exceptions in listener implementations propagate to the caller or event dispatcher.
 * Consider wrapping handler logic with appropriate error handling to prevent event processing failures.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Usage Examples:</b>
 * <pre>{@code
 * // Lambda expression registration
 * EventListener<User> listener = user -> log.info("User created: {}", user.getName());
 * 
 * // Method reference registration
 * services.applicationEvent.registerEventListener(ApplicationEvent.USER_CREATED, this::handleUserCreated);
 * 
 * // Functional composition
 * EventListener<User> composed = listener.andThen(user -> sendEmail(user));
 * }</pre>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This is a SAM (Single Abstract Method) interface, inheriting {@code accept(T)} from Consumer,
 * which enables seamless lambda usage and functional programming patterns.
 * </p>
