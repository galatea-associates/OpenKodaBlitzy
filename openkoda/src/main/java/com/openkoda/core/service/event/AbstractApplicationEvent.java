/**
 * Abstract base class for typed application event descriptors providing event registry and metadata management.
 * <p>
 * This class maintains a static registry (HashMap) of all event descriptors keyed by eventName for event lookup
 * and discovery across the application. Subclasses (such as ApplicationEvent) declare canonical application-wide
 * event types (USER_CREATED, ORGANIZATION_UPDATED, etc.) as static final instances.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Event descriptors are effectively immutable after construction, with all fields being final. The static registry
 * is populated during class initialization and should not be modified at runtime.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Thread-Safety Warning:</b> The static eventList HashMap is NOT synchronized. Registration occurs during
 * class initialization and should not be modified concurrently at runtime.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Example usage:
 * <pre>{@code
 * // Event lookup
 * AbstractApplicationEvent event = AbstractApplicationEvent.getEvent("user.created");
 * 
 * // Type-safe usage in ApplicationEvent subclass
 * public static final ApplicationEvent<User> USER_CREATED = 
 *     new ApplicationEvent<>(User.class, "user.created");
 * }</pre>
 * </p>
 *
 * @param <T> Payload type that event consumers will receive when this event is published (e.g., User, Organization, SchedulerDto)
 * @author Arkadiusz Drysch (adrysch@stratoflow.com)
 * @author OpenKoda Team
 * @since 1.7.1
 * @see ApplicationEvent for concrete event type definitions
 * @see ApplicationEventService for event publishing and listener registration
