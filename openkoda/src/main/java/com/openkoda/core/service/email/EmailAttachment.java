/**
 * Contract for email attachment data providers.
 * <p>
 * This interface provides an abstraction for email attachments used by MIME builders
 * and mail composition code within the email subsystem. Implementations supply both
 * the attachment filename and the binary content payload.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Typical implementations include:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>File-backed attachments reading from disk or classpath resources</li>
 *   <li>In-memory byte arrays for dynamically generated content</li>
 *   <li>Database-backed attachments streaming from BLOB columns</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Memory Considerations:</b> Since {@link #getData()} returns the full byte array,
 * all attachment content is loaded into memory. For large attachments (e.g., multi-megabyte
 * PDFs or high-resolution images), this can result in significant heap pressure. Consider
 * attachment size limits and memory capacity when implementing this interface.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Used by {@link SmtpEmailSender}, {@link MailgunEmailSender}, and other email sender
 * implementations to attach files to outgoing email messages.
 * </p>

    * <b>In-Memory Payload Implications:</b> Since this method returns a full byte array

    * <ul>
    *   <li>Increased heap memory consumption</li>

    *   <li>Performance impact from byte array copying</li>

    * Implementations should consider imposing size limits or providing streaming
    * alternatives for large file support.
