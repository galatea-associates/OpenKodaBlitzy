/**
 * Testing and development EmailSender implementation that writes email details to System.out/console
 * instead of actually sending emails.
 * <p>
 * This class provides a safe email sender for local development and testing environments that logs
 * complete email message details (sender, recipient, subject, HTML content, attachments) to the console
 * without performing any actual email delivery. This prevents accidental email delivery to real
 * recipients during development, debugging, or automated testing.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The sender is activated only when the Spring "local" profile is active ({@code @Profile("local")}),
 * ensuring that real email delivery mechanisms are used in production environments. When active, the
 * {@code @Primary} annotation makes this implementation the default EmailSender bean, taking precedence
 * over production senders like SmtpEmailSender or MailgunEmailSender.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This implementation extends the {@link EmailSender} abstract base class and overrides the
 * {@link #sendEmail(String, String, String, String, String, List)} method to log email details
 * via {@code info()} logging instead of delivering messages. All calls return {@code true} to
 * simulate successful delivery, allowing the email sending workflow to complete normally.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Usage notes:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Activated by including "local" in {@code spring.profiles.active} property</li>
 * <li>Useful for testing email composition without SMTP configuration</li>
 * <li>Logs full email content for visual verification in development</li>
 * <li>No actual network I/O or external service dependencies</li>
 * <li>Always returns {@code true} to simulate successful delivery</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
