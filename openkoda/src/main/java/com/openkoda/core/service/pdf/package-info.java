/**
 * Services for PDF document generation and manipulation through HTML-to-PDF conversion.
 * <p>
 * This package provides enterprise-grade PDF generation capabilities by converting
 * Thymeleaf HTML templates into PDF documents. The primary use cases include report
 * generation, invoice printing, document exports, and template-based PDF creation.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Package Architecture</h2>
 * <p>
 * The core component is {@link com.openkoda.core.service.pdf.PdfConstructor}, which
 * orchestrates the complete PDF generation workflow:
 * </p>
 * <ol>
 *     <li>Thymeleaf templates are rendered to HTML with variable substitution</li>
 *     <li>Jsoup normalizes the HTML to valid XHTML using XML parser</li>
 *     <li>Flying Saucer's ITextRenderer converts XHTML to PDF with CSS styling</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * The service supports multi-page PDF generation through varargs model parameters,
 * allowing multiple data models to be rendered as separate pages within a single PDF document.
 * Localization is handled automatically via Spring's {@code LocaleContextHolder} integration.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Library Integrations</h2>
 * <p><b>Thymeleaf TemplateEngine:</b> Renders templates to HTML with variable substitution
 * from model maps. All templates receive a {@code baseUrl} variable for absolute resource URLs.</p>
 * <p><b>Jsoup with XML Parser:</b> Normalizes HTML output to XHTML format required by
 * the PDF renderer, ensuring well-formed XML structure.</p>
 * <p><b>Flying Saucer ITextRenderer:</b> Converts XHTML to PDF documents with CSS styling
 * support. Creates new renderer instances per generation call for thread safety.</p>
 * <p><b>Spring Framework:</b> Provides {@code @Service} bean registration, {@code @Value}
 * configuration injection, and {@code @Inject} dependency management.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Configuration Properties</h2>
 * <p>
 * The PDF generation service uses the following configurable properties:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li><b>base.url</b> (default: {@code http://localhost:8080}): Base URL injected into
 *     all template contexts for resolving absolute resource paths</li>
 *     <li><b>mail.from</b> (default: empty): Email sender identifier for email-related templates</li>
 *     <li><b>font.path</b> (default: {@code /fonts/arialuni.ttf}): Path to custom font file
 *     for Unicode character support in generated PDFs</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Usage Patterns</h2>
 * <p><b>Single-page PDF generation:</b></p>
 * <pre>
 * byte[] pdf = pdfConstructor.writeDocumentToByteArray("invoice", modelMap);
 * </pre>
 * <p><b>Multi-page PDF with multiple models:</b></p>
 * <pre>
 * pdfConstructor.writeDocumentToOutputStream("report", outputStream, model1, model2);
 * </pre>
 * <p><b>Streaming PDF to HTTP response:</b></p>
 * <pre>
 * pdfConstructor.writeDocumentToOutputStream("template", response.getOutputStream(), data);
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>CSS Styling Considerations</h2>
 * <p>
 * CSS styles must be XHTML-compatible for Flying Saucer rendering. The renderer supports
 * a subset of CSS 2.1 specifications. Images and fonts should be referenced as embedded
 * resources or absolute URLs. Custom font embedding may be required for international
 * character support beyond standard Latin character sets.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Thread Safety</h2>
 * <p>
 * The PDF generation service is designed for thread-safe operation. A new {@code ITextRenderer}
 * instance is created for each PDF generation call, ensuring no state sharing between
 * concurrent requests. The injected {@code TemplateEngine} is thread-safe per Thymeleaf's
 * design, allowing safe concurrent template rendering.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Error Handling</h2>
 * <p>
 * Exceptions during PDF generation are caught and logged using the request-scoped logging
 * component. Errors are not propagated to callers; instead, the service returns control
 * after logging. Callers should monitor logs for generation failure detection. Output
 * streams are always closed in finally blocks to prevent resource leaks.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Integration with Other Modules</h2>
 * <p>
 * This package depends on:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@code com.openkoda.core.tracker} for request-scoped logging with correlation IDs</li>
 *     <li>{@code com.openkoda.core.configuration} for Thymeleaf template resolution</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * It is used by:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Report generation features in the application</li>
 *     <li>Document export controllers for invoice and receipt printing</li>
 *     <li>Email attachment services for PDF document delivery</li>
 * </ul>
