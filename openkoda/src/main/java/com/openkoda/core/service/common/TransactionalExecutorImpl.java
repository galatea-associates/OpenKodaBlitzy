/**
 * Spring-managed service that implements programmatic transaction management via the {@link TransactionalExecutor} interface.
 * <p>
 * This service provides methods for executing code within Spring-managed transactions with configurable transaction attributes.
 * It is used when declarative {@code @Transactional} annotation is insufficient, such as when dynamic transaction requirements,
 * conditional transaction boundaries, or programmatic control are needed. The service works with Spring's
 * {@code PlatformTransactionManager} and AOP proxying to ensure proper transaction semantics.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This implementation also extends {@link LoggingComponentWithRequestId} to provide request correlation IDs for tracing
 * and debugging across transaction boundaries. The service is a stateless singleton that is safe for concurrent use
 * across multiple threads and requests.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Example usage:
 * <pre>{@code
 * transactionalExecutor.executeInTransaction(() -> repository.save(entity));
 * }</pre>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Comparison with @Transactional:</b> Use this programmatic approach when transaction boundaries cannot be determined
 * at compile time, when multiple transaction configurations are needed conditionally, or when fine-grained control over
 * transaction propagation is required. For standard use cases, prefer declarative {@code @Transactional} annotation for
 * simplicity and clarity.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Important:</b> This service requires Spring context injection to ensure AOP interception. Direct instantiation or
 * self-invocation bypasses transactional semantics and will not create transaction boundaries.
 * </p>

     * {@code rollbackFor = Exception.class} ensures rollback for both checked and unchecked exceptions, which differs

     * This generic approach allows the method to handle any return type from the transactional operation.
