/**
 * Provides common utility services for cross-cutting transaction management concerns.
 * This package contains foundation services used throughout the OpenKoda application.
 * These services are not specific to any business domain but provide shared infrastructure.
 * <p>
 * The primary component in this package is the transaction execution service, which offers
 * programmatic transaction control when declarative Spring {@code @Transactional} annotations
 * are insufficient. This enables fine-grained transaction demarcation for complex workflows
 * that require dynamic transaction boundaries or multiple transaction scopes within a single
 * operation.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Key features include:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Programmatic transaction execution with custom propagation and isolation levels</li>
 *   <li>Integration with Spring's {@code PlatformTransactionManager} infrastructure</li>
 *   <li>Support for nested transactions and savepoint management</li>
 *   <li>Exception handling and rollback control for transactional operations</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Use cases for services in this package include:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Dynamic entity operations requiring transaction control during runtime class generation</li>
 *   <li>Batch processing operations with custom transaction boundaries</li>
 *   <li>Integration scenarios where external system calls must be isolated from local transactions</li>
 *   <li>Flow pipeline execution requiring explicit transaction management</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
