import java.io.Serializable;

/**
 * Immutable serializable DTO propagating configuration lifecycle events across distributed application instances via Hazelcast cluster messaging.
 * <p>
 * This class enables cross-node synchronization of stateful configuration (Schedulers, EventListeners, Forms) in multi-instance deployments.
 * Events are published by ClusterEventSenderService to a Hazelcast topic and consumed by ClusterEventListenerService on all cluster nodes.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Active only in 'hazelcast' profile for clustered deployments; no-op in single-instance mode. Implements {@link Serializable} for Hazelcast network transport.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <strong>WARNING:</strong> Lacks explicit serialVersionUID which may cause deserialization issues across versions. Final fields ensure thread-safe message passing;
 * instances are created once and published to the topic.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Currently supports three stateful configuration areas:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li><strong>Schedulers</strong> - Synchronizes scheduled task configuration across nodes</li>
 * <li><strong>EventListeners</strong> - Synchronizes event consumer registration across nodes</li>
 * <li><strong>Forms</strong> - Synchronizes form definitions and triggers dynamic entity generation</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The third potential area (Logs) is not critical for cluster propagation.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <strong>Usage Example:</strong>
 * <pre>{@code
 * clusterEventSenderService.sendSchedulerCreated(schedulerId);
 * }</pre>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <strong>Design Notes:</strong>
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Use ClusterEvent for cross-node configuration sync; ApplicationEvent for in-process business events</li>
 * <li>Events are published to Hazelcast ITopic&lt;ClusterEvent&gt; named cluster topic</li>
 * <li>Published after database commit to ensure entity exists when other nodes reload</li>
 * <li>Handler operations should be idempotent as events may be received multiple times in rare failure scenarios</li>
 * </ul>
