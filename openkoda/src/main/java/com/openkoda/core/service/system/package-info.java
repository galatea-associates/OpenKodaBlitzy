/**
 * Provides system-level infrastructure services for database schema validation, health monitoring, 
 * IP resolution, and privilege checking in the OpenKoda platform.
 * <p>
 * This package contains cross-cutting utility services that support administrative tooling, 
 * health endpoints, form import workflows, and runtime diagnostics throughout the application.
 * These services provide essential infrastructure capabilities used by controllers, startup 
 * checks, and operational monitoring systems.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Key Classes</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>DatabaseValidationService</b> - Performs schema reconciliation by comparing 
 *       FrontendMapping metadata definitions against actual JDBC database schema. Used during 
 *       form import validation and dynamic entity generation to detect schema mismatches.</li>
 *   <li><b>SystemHealthStatusService</b> - Aggregates health monitoring metrics from JVM runtime, 
 *       filesystem storage, and PostgreSQL database connections. Provides comprehensive health 
 *       status data for the ApplicationStatusController /ping endpoint.</li>
 *   <li><b>IpResolverService</b> - Resolves client IP addresses from HTTP requests, handling 
 *       proxy headers and forwarded-for chains for accurate request tracking and audit logging.</li>
 *   <li><b>PrivilegeHelperService</b> - Provides runtime privilege evaluation utilities for 
 *       checking user access rights and computing privilege tokens based on organizational context.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Package Purpose</h2>
 * <p>
 * The system service subpackage delivers foundational infrastructure capabilities that are used 
 * across the entire OpenKoda platform. These services handle system-level concerns such as:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Database schema validation and consistency checking for dynamic entities</li>
 *   <li>Application health monitoring and status reporting for operational visibility</li>
 *   <li>IP address resolution for security audit trails and request tracking</li>
 *   <li>Privilege computation and access control evaluation for authorization workflows</li>
 *   <li>Runtime diagnostics and system information gathering for troubleshooting</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Integration Patterns</h2>
 * <p>
 * Services in this package follow consistent integration patterns throughout the OpenKoda 
 * architecture:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>ComponentProvider Extension</b> - Services extend ComponentProvider to gain access 
 *       to common infrastructure components and repositories via dependency injection.</li>
 *   <li><b>Logging Integration</b> - Services implement LoggingComponentWithRequestId to 
 *       correlate log entries with request tracking IDs for distributed tracing.</li>
 *   <li><b>Dependency Injection</b> - Services rely on constructor injection of infrastructure 
 *       dependencies including DataSource, FrontendMapping registry, and EntityManagerFactory.</li>
 *   <li><b>Spring Bean Registration</b> - All services are registered as Spring beans with 
 *       singleton scope for application-wide access via the Services aggregator.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Usage Contexts</h2>
 * <p>
 * System services are consumed throughout the OpenKoda platform in various operational contexts:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Health Endpoints</b> - ApplicationStatusController invokes SystemHealthStatusService 
 *       for GET /ping responses with JVM and database health metrics.</li>
 *   <li><b>Form Import Validation</b> - DatabaseValidationService validates FrontendMapping 
 *       definitions against database schema before persisting dynamic form configurations.</li>
 *   <li><b>Dynamic Entity Generation</b> - Schema validation ensures generated entities match 
 *       expected database structures during Byte Buddy class synthesis.</li>
 *   <li><b>Audit Logging</b> - IpResolverService extracts client IP addresses for audit trail 
 *       entries captured by AuditInterceptor.</li>
 *   <li><b>Startup Checks</b> - Health monitoring services verify database connectivity and 
 *       system resources during application initialization.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Design Patterns</h2>
 * <p>
 * The system service implementation follows established design patterns for reliability and 
 * maintainability:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Stateless Services</b> - All services are stateless and safe for concurrent access 
 *       from multiple threads without synchronization.</li>
 *   <li><b>Defensive Exception Handling</b> - Services use try-catch blocks with conservative 
 *       defaults to prevent cascading failures in non-critical operations.</li>
 *   <li><b>External Process Execution</b> - Health monitoring may execute OS-level diagnostic 
 *       commands (e.g., disk space checks) with proper timeout and error handling.</li>
 *   <li><b>Caching Integration</b> - Services leverage RequestSessionCacheService for 
 *       memoization of expensive operations within request scope.</li>
 *   <li><b>Transactional Boundaries</b> - Database validation operations respect Spring 
 *       transaction boundaries for consistent schema introspection.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Thread Safety</h2>
 * <p>
 * All services in this package are designed for safe concurrent access. Services maintain no 
 * mutable state and rely only on injected dependencies that are themselves thread-safe. 
 * Database operations use connection pooling with proper isolation guarantees.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Dependencies</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Spring Framework - Bean lifecycle and dependency injection</li>
 *   <li>JPA/Hibernate - Database schema introspection via JDBC metadata</li>
 *   <li>Jakarta Servlet API - HTTP request processing for IP resolution</li>
 *   <li>OpenKoda Core - LoggingComponentWithRequestId, ComponentProvider</li>
 *   <li>OpenKoda Model - FrontendMapping metadata, privilege definitions</li>
 * </ul>
