/**
 * Context wrapper for ServerJS thread execution providing runtime utilities and system integration.
 * <p>
 * This class serves as the execution context for server-side JavaScript threads, exposing a comprehensive
 * set of utility methods to ServerJS scripts running within the OpenKoda platform. It provides capabilities
 * for logging, data type conversion, event emission, file system operations, and command-line process execution.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * An instance of ServerJSProcessRunner is created for each ServerJS execution and injected into the JavaScript
 * context, making its public methods callable from JavaScript code. The class manages thread registration,
 * log capture, and provides safe command execution across Windows (WSL) and Linux platforms.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Key responsibilities include:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Thread registry management for tracking active ServerJS executions</li>
 *   <li>Log capture and streaming to configured writers</li>
 *   <li>Service bean exposure to JavaScript context</li>
 *   <li>OS-agnostic command execution (bash on Linux, WSL bash on Windows)</li>
 *   <li>Type conversion helpers for JavaScript-Java interoperability</li>
 *   <li>Asynchronous event emission to application event bus</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Example usage pattern from ServerJSRunner:
 * <pre>{@code
 * ServerJSProcessRunner runner = new ServerJSProcessRunner(services, logWriter);
 * String result = runner.runCommandToString("ls -la /tmp");
 * }</pre>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Thread Safety:</b> The static {@code serverJsThreads} registry uses a LinkedHashMap and is accessed
 * concurrently. Manual synchronization is required when modifying the registry beyond the automatic
 * cleanup performed in the constructor.
 * </p>
