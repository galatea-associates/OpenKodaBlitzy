/**
 * Minimal Spring Session web initializer that triggers automatic servlet filter and listener registration.
 * <p>
 * This class extends {@link AbstractHttpSessionApplicationInitializer} with an empty body. The presence of this
 * class on the classpath activates Spring Session automatic configuration hooks through the Servlet 3.0+
 * WebApplicationInitializer SPI. The parent class handles all initialization logic including registration of the
 * springSessionRepositoryFilter and the SessionEventHttpSessionListenerAdapter.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Removing this class disables Spring Session and breaks distributed session behavior in clustered deployments.
 * No custom logic is required as the parent class handles all initialization through the onStartup() method.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <strong>Important:</strong> Required for Spring Session WebApplicationInitializer SPI detection. Must be present
 * for distributed session support to function correctly.
 * </p>
 *
 * @since 1.7.1
 * @author OpenKoda Team
 * @version 1.7.1
