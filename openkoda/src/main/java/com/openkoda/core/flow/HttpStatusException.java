/**
 * Abstract exception that couples an HTTP status code with error handling in Flow pipelines.
 * <p>
 * This exception enables REST API error handling with proper HTTP status codes. When thrown
 * during Flow pipeline execution, {@link Flow#execute()} catches this exception and uses the
 * {@link #status} field to determine the HTTP response status code for the client.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Flow treats HttpStatusException specially compared to generic exceptions. While generic
 * exceptions result in HTTP 500 (Internal Server Error), HttpStatusException allows
 * controllers to return specific status codes like 404 (Not Found), 403 (Forbidden),
 * or 401 (Unauthorized) by throwing the appropriate subclass.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Example usage with concrete subclass:
 * <pre>
 * if (!hasPermission) { throw new ForbiddenException(); }
 * </pre>
 * </p>
 *
 * @see Flow
 * @see ResponseEntity
