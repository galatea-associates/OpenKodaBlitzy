/**
 * Transactional boundary interface for wrapping Flow pipeline execution in Spring transactional context.
 * <p>
 * Provides transaction demarcation for Flow steps, ensuring atomicity of operations and automatic
 * rollback on exceptions. Implementations delegate to Spring's transaction infrastructure to
 * provide consistent transactional behavior across Flow pipeline executions.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This interface serves as an abstraction over Spring's transaction management, allowing Flow
 * pipelines to execute within managed transactions without direct coupling to Spring's
 * transaction APIs. The interface uses raw types for flexibility with Flow's internal generic handling.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Example usage within Flow pipeline:
 * <pre>{@code
 * TransactionalExecutor executor = ...;
 * Object result = executor.executeInTransaction(() -> performDatabaseOperations());
 * }</pre>
 * </p>
 *
 * @author OpenKoda Team
 * @version 1.7.1
 * @since 1.7.1
 * @see Flow
 * @see org.springframework.transaction.annotation.Transactional

     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Implementations typically delegate to Spring's TransactionTemplate or use @Transactional
