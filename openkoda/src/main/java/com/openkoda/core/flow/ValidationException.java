/**
 * RuntimeException marker for validation failures in Flow pipeline execution.
 * <p>
 * This exception signals business-level validation errors during Flow processing.
 * The Flow pipeline catches this exception and sets {@code BasePageAttributes.isError} to true,
 * then stores the error message in the model for display to users.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Unlike {@link HttpStatusException}, which maps errors to specific HTTP status codes,
 * ValidationException represents validation logic failures that do not require
 * transaction rollback annotations. Flow handles this exception specially by capturing
 * the message and preserving the execution context for error presentation.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Usage example:
 * <pre>{@code
 * if (user.getEmail() == null) {
 *     throw new ValidationException("Email address is required");
 * }
 * }</pre>
 * </p>
 *
 * @see Flow
 * @see BasePageAttributes
 * @see HttpStatusException
