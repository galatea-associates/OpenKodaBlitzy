/**
 * Declares canonical typed page attribute constants for OpenKoda controllers and views.
 * <p>
 * This interface provides standardized {@link PageAttr} constants that avoid ad-hoc string keys
 * when passing data between controllers, Flow pipelines, and view templates. Each constant
 * represents a commonly-used page attribute with strong typing for type-safe data access.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * These attributes are used in Flow pipelines to set error states, messages, and validation
 * results that are rendered in Thymeleaf templates. Using these typed constants prevents
 * typos and enables IDE auto-completion.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Example usage in a Flow pipeline:
 * <pre>{@code
 * Flow.init()
 *     .thenSet(isError, a -> true)
 *     .thenSet(message, a -> "Operation completed successfully");
 * }</pre>
