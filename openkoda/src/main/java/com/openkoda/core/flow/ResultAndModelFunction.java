 * Functional interface for lambda-friendly mapping from {@link ResultAndModel} to result type.

 * This interface is used in Flow pipelines to transform intermediate results and model state
 * into new results. It enables concise lambda expressions that extract or compute values from
 * the combined result and model context.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Example usage in Flow pipeline:
 * <pre>{@code
 * ResultAndModelFunction<User, Organization> mapper = 
 *     (resultAndModel) -> resultAndModel.result;
 * }</pre>
 * </p>
 * 
 * @param <R> the result type returned by this function
 * @param <I> the input result type from ResultAndModel
 * @see ResultAndModel
 * @see PageModelFunction
 * @since 1.7.1
