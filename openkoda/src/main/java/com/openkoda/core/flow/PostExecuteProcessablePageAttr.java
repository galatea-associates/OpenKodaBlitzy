/**
 * Marker interface for PageAttr values that require post-execution processing after Flow pipeline completion.
 * <p>
 * This interface enables automatic finalization or cleanup operations for values stored in the Flow pipeline's
 * PageModelMap. When a Flow pipeline completes successfully, the Flow executor automatically invokes the
 * {@link #process()} method on all PageAttr values that implement this interface.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Processing occurs only after successful execution of all pipeline steps. If an exception occurs during
 * Flow execution, post-execution processing is skipped to prevent inconsistent state.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Example usage:
 * <pre>
 * public class CleanupResource implements PostExecuteProcessablePageAttr {
 *     public void process() { /* finalization logic */ }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * </p>
 *
