/**
 * Result carrier combining HTTP response/result with view model data, enabling functional
 * composition in Flow pipelines.
 * <p>
 * This class bundles all context needed for result transformation during Flow pipeline execution.
 * It packages the result value, the accumulated PageModelMap containing view data, service context,
 * and additional parameters into a single immutable carrier. Flow steps receive ResultAndModel
 * instances as input and produce new results through functional transformations.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The {@link #mav(ResultAndModelFunction, ResultAndModelFunction)} method dispatches to success
 * or error ResultAndModelFunction providers based on {@link BasePageAttributes#isError} flag,
 * enabling conditional result generation for successful vs failed executions.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Example usage in Flow pipeline:
 * <pre>{@code
 * Flow.init(services)
 *     .thenSet(entity, a -> repository.findOne(id))
 *     .then(a -> new Result(a.result))
 *     .execute();
 * }</pre>
 * </p>
 *
 * @param <R> the result type carried by this instance
 * @param <CP> the context/services type (typically a services aggregator bean)
