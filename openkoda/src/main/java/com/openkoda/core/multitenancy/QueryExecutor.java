/**
 * Centralized low-level database interaction component for executing SQL queries and EntityManager operations.
 * <p>
 * QueryExecutor provides a unified interface for database operations with comprehensive lifecycle management.
 * It creates EntityManager instances, configures them, executes operations, and ensures proper cleanup.
 * The component supports both transactional and non-transactional execution modes, integrates with
 * TenantResolver for tenant-aware operations, and provides automatic resource loading from classpath.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Key capabilities include:
 * <ul>
 * <li>EntityManager lifecycle management with automatic cleanup via try-finally blocks</li>
 * <li>Optional transaction control: transactional execution with commit/rollback or auto-commit mode</li>
 * <li>Tenant-aware query execution integrated with TenantResolver and SchemaSupportingConnectionProvider</li>
 * <li>Automatic classpath resource loading for SQL scripts</li>
 * <li>Schema introspection via getSchemas() for discovering tenant schemas</li>
 * <li>Comprehensive error handling with logging and transaction rollback</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Thread-safety: This component uses a stateless design with no instance state beyond the injected
 * EntityManagerFactory. Each method invocation creates an isolated EntityManager, making it safe for
 * concurrent use by multiple threads in the service layer.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Transaction management: Transactional methods use JPA EntityTransaction (not Spring @Transactional).
 * Transactions are automatically rolled back on any exception. Auto-commit mode is used for
 * non-transactional operations.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Tenant-aware execution: TenantResolver.getTenantedResource() provides tenant context, and
 * SchemaSupportingConnectionProvider automatically sets the PostgreSQL search_path to execute
 * queries against tenant-specific schemas (org_&lt;organizationId&gt;).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Usage patterns:
 * <pre>{@code
 * // Execute SQL script from classpath
 * queryExecutor.runQueryFromResourceInTransaction("/sql/init-tenant.sql");
 * 
 * // Execute EntityManager operation with transaction
 * queryExecutor.runEntityManagerOperationInTransaction(em -> {
 *     return em.find(Organization.class, orgId);
 * });
 * }</pre>
 * </p>
