/**
 * Session-scoped Hibernate Interceptor delegating entity lifecycle events to AuditInterceptor for audit trail capture.
 * <p>
 * Implements Hibernate Interceptor SPI to hook into entity lifecycle events (onSave, onFlushDirty, onDelete, 
 * beforeTransactionCompletion). Maintains per-session ConcurrentHashMap (auditMap) accumulating AuditedObjectState 
 * entries during transaction. Delegates actual change detection to singleton AuditInterceptor resolved at runtime 
 * via ApplicationContextProvider to avoid circular dependency. Hibernate creates one instance per session, ensuring 
 * auditMap is session-scoped and thread-isolated.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>CRITICAL Configuration:</b> Must be configured in application.properties:
 * {@code spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.ejb.interceptor.session_scoped=com.openkoda.core.audit.PropertyChangeInterceptor}
 * Without this property, audit trail will not function.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Instance Lifecycle:</b> Created per Hibernate session, destroyed when session closes. auditMap accumulates 
 * changes during flush operations, cleared implicitly on transaction commit via beforeTransactionCompletion delegation.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Thread Safety:</b> Each Hibernate session has its own instance, so auditMap is naturally thread-isolated. 
 * ConcurrentHashMap used for extra safety but not strictly necessary given session isolation.
 * </p>
