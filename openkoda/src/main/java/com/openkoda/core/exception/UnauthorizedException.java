/**
 * Exception thrown when a user attempts to access a resource without proper authentication.
 * <p>
 * This exception represents HTTP 401 Unauthorized status, which indicates that authentication
 * is required but has failed or has not been provided. Common scenarios include missing
 * credentials, invalid tokens, or expired authentication sessions.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This differs from HTTP 403 Forbidden, which indicates the user is authenticated but lacks
 * authorization to access the resource. Use this exception for authentication failures, not
 * authorization denials.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The {@code @ResponseStatus} annotation automatically maps this exception to HTTP 401
 * when thrown from Spring MVC controllers. Spring handles serialization and error response
 * generation. The exception extends {@link HttpStatusException} to allow programmatic
 * inspection of the HTTP status code.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The {@code serialVersionUID} field ensures serialization stability across versions when
 * this exception is transmitted across network boundaries or persisted.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Example usage in authentication filter:
 * <pre>{@code
 * if (jwtToken == null || !jwtValidator.isValid(jwtToken)) {
 *     throw new UnauthorizedException("Invalid JWT token");
 * }
 * }</pre>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Example usage in service layer:
 * <pre>{@code
 * if (!authenticationService.isAuthenticated(request)) {
 *     throw new UnauthorizedException();
 * }
 * }</pre>
 * </p>
