/**
 * Generic repository contract for decoupling UI settings forms from persistence.
 * <p>
 * This interface provides a standard contract for retrieving user-specific settings entities
 * that are displayed and edited on custom settings pages. It allows the settings customization
 * framework to remain agnostic of specific entity types while enabling type-safe form bindings.
 * The repository typically returns an entity with a 1-to-1 relationship to the User entity.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Implementations of this interface are registered with the customization framework via
 * {@link com.openkoda.core.customisation.BasicCustomisationService#registerSettingsForm}.
 * The framework invokes {@link #findOneForUserId(Long)} to populate form data and bind
 * user-specific settings to the settings page UI.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Implementation responsibilities:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Define null-handling semantics (return null vs. throw exception for missing settings)</li>
 *   <li>Manage transaction boundaries for settings retrieval</li>
 *   <li>Ensure proper user ID validation and authorization checks if needed</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * @param <T> the type of settings entity associated with a user
 * @author Arkadiusz Drysch (adrysch@stratoflow.com)

     * </p>
     * <p>
