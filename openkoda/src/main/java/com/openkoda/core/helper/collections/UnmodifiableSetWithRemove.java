/**
 * An unmodifiable set implementation that permits removal operations but blocks all additions.
 * <p>
 * This class uses the decorator pattern by extending {@link HashSet} to provide selective
 * mutability. While typical unmodifiable collections block all modifications, this implementation
 * allows removal operations ({@code remove}, {@code clear}, {@code iterator().remove()},
 * {@code removeAll}, {@code retainAll}) to remain functional while preventing any additions
 * via {@code add} or {@code addAll} methods.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The {@code add} and {@code addAll} operations throw {@link UnsupportedOperationException}
 * to enforce the no-addition policy. All removal-related APIs inherited from {@link HashSet}
 * remain operative and will successfully delete elements from the set.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Example usage:
 * <pre>{@code
 * Set<String> original = Set.of("a", "b", "c");
 * UnmodifiableSetWithRemove<String> set = new UnmodifiableSetWithRemove<>(original);
 * set.remove("a"); // succeeds
 * }</pre>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Thread-safety: This class is not thread-safe. It inherits the non-synchronized behavior
 * from {@link HashSet}. External synchronization is required for concurrent access.
 * </p>
 *
 * @param <E> the type of elements maintained by this set
 * @author OpenKoda Team
 * @version 1.7.1
