/**
 * Functional interface for three-argument functions.
 * <p>
 * This interface extends Java's functional programming support beyond the standard
 * {@link java.util.function.BiFunction} by accepting three input parameters instead of two.
 * It represents a function that takes three arguments and produces a result.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This is a functional interface whose functional method is {@link #apply(Object, Object, Object)}.
 * As such, it can be used as the assignment target for lambda expressions or method references.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Example usage with lambda:
 * <pre>{@code
 * Function3<String, Integer, Boolean, String> formatter =
 *     (s, i, b) -> s + i + (b ? " active" : " inactive");
 * String result = formatter.apply("User", 42, true);
 * }</pre>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <strong>Thread Safety:</strong> This interface is stateless and inherently thread-safe.
 * However, thread-safety of specific implementations depends on the lambda or method reference used.
 * </p>
 *
 * @param <T1> the type of the first argument to the function
 * @param <T2> the type of the second argument to the function
 * @param <T3> the type of the third argument to the function
 * @param <R> the type of the result of the function
 * @author Arkadiusz Drysch (adrysch@stratoflow.com)
 * @author OpenKoda Team
 * @version 1.7.1
 * @since 1.7.1
 * @see java.util.function.BiFunction
