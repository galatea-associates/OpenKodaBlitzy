/**
 * Spring HandlerInterceptor that redirects non-root requests ending with trailing slash to slashless path.
 * <p>
 * This interceptor normalizes URLs for SEO and canonical URL consistency by removing trailing slashes
 * from all paths except the root path "/". When a request URI ends with a trailing slash (and is not
 * the root), the interceptor performs an HTTP redirect to the same path without the trailing slash.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Important: This interceptor does not preserve query strings during redirect. For example, a request
 * to "/users/?page=1" will redirect to "/users" without the page parameter. This limitation should be
 * considered when using this interceptor with parameterized requests.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Example usage:
 * <pre>
 * Request to "/users/" redirects to "/users"
 * Request to "/" is preserved (root path not redirected)
 * </pre>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Thread-safety: This interceptor is stateless and safe for concurrent use across multiple requests.
 * </p>

     * Intercepts incoming requests and redirects non-root paths ending with trailing slash.
     * <p>
     * This method examines the request URI and performs the following logic:
     * <ul>
     * <li>Root path "/" is preserved without redirect</li>
     * <li>Non-root paths ending with "/" are redirected to the same path without trailing slash</li>
     * <li>All other paths continue processing normally</li>
     * </ul>
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Redirect logic example:
     * <pre>
     * "/users/" -> redirects to "/users" (returns false)
     * "/" -> no redirect (returns true)
     * "/users" -> no redirect (returns true)
     * </pre>
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Note: Query strings are not preserved during redirect. A request to "/users/?page=1"
     * will redirect to "/users" without the page parameter.
     * </p>
     *
     * @param request current HTTP servlet request
     * @param response current HTTP servlet response used for sending redirect
     * @param handler chosen handler for request execution
     * @return {@code false} if redirect was performed (stops request processing),
     *         {@code true} to continue with normal request processing
     * @throws Exception if the redirect operation fails
