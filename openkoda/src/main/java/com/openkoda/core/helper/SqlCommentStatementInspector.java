/**
 * Hibernate StatementInspector that enhances SQL statements for observability and user context injection.
 * <p>
 * This inspector performs two key operations on all SQL statements executed through Hibernate:
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Replaces {@code USER_ID_PLACEHOLDER} tokens with the actual user ID from the security context</li>
 *   <li>Appends the current request ID as a SQL comment for request tracing in database logs</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * The placeholder replacement enables dynamic user-scoped queries where the user ID is injected
 * at execution time rather than query construction time. The request ID comment enables correlation
 * between application logs and database query logs for troubleshooting and performance monitoring.
 * <p>
 * <b>Use Cases:</b>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Database query logging correlation - trace queries back to originating HTTP requests</li>
 *   <li>Performance monitoring - identify slow queries by request ID</li>
 *   <li>Audit trails - associate database operations with authenticated users</li>
 *   <li>Query fingerprinting - consistent comment format aids log analysis tools</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <b>Important Warnings:</b>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Query Plan Caching:</b> Altering literal SQL text means each request generates unique SQL,
 *       which may reduce effectiveness of database query plan caches</li>
 *   <li><b>SQL Fingerprinting:</b> Appended comments affect query fingerprinting algorithms that
 *       group similar queries - ensure monitoring tools strip comments before fingerprinting</li>
 *   <li><b>PII Exposure:</b> User IDs and request IDs appear in SQL logs, which may contain
 *       personally identifiable information - ensure database logs have appropriate access controls</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <b>Thread Safety:</b> This inspector is safe for concurrent use as it reads from thread-local
 * storage ({@link RequestIdHolder}) and does not maintain mutable state.
 * <p>
 * <b>Performance:</b> The regex replacement and string concatenation operations add minimal overhead
 * (typically &lt;1ms per query) to SQL execution.
 * <p>
 * Example of SQL transformation:
 * <pre>
 * // Original SQL with placeholder
 * SELECT * FROM organizations WHERE created_by = '__USER_ID__'
 * 
 * // Transformed SQL with user ID and request comment
 * SELECT * FROM organizations WHERE created_by = '12345' /*req-abc-123*/
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * This inspector is automatically invoked by Hibernate for all SQL statements when configured
 * in the Hibernate settings.

     * Inspects and modifies SQL statements to inject user context and request tracing information.
     * <p>
     * This method performs two transformations on the provided SQL statement:
     * <ol>
     *   <li>If the SQL contains {@link ModelConstants#USER_ID_PLACEHOLDER}, replaces all occurrences
     *       with the actual user ID from {@link UserProvider#getUserIdOrNotExistingIdAsString()}</li>
     *   <li>Appends the current request ID from {@link RequestIdHolder} as a SQL comment in the
     *       format {@code /* request-id */}</li>
     * </ol>
     * <p>
     * The placeholder substitution uses {@code String.replaceAll()} with the placeholder as a
     * literal regex pattern, replacing all occurrences in the SQL string. The request ID is
     * concatenated as a trailing comment using {@code String.format()}.
     * <p>
     * If no placeholder is present, the SQL is passed directly to request ID injection without
     * user ID substitution.
     * <p>
     * Example transformation:
     * <pre>
     * // Input SQL
     * "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = '__USER_ID__'"
     * 
     * // Output SQL (assuming user ID 12345 and request ID req-abc-123)
     * "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = '12345' /*req-abc-123*/"
     * </pre>
     *
     * @param sql the original SQL statement to inspect and modify, must not be null
     * @return modified SQL statement with user ID placeholder replaced (if present) and request ID
     *         appended as a comment. Returns the original SQL with only request ID comment if no
     *         placeholder is found or if request ID is not available.

     * @see UserProvider#getUserIdOrNotExistingIdAsString()
     * @see RequestIdHolder#getId()
