/**
 * Provides cluster configuration metadata and node detection using Hazelcast.
 * <p>
 * This helper computes master and member status from injected properties and exposes
 * a static API for cluster information access. The static instance is initialized via
 * {@code @PostConstruct} during Spring bean lifecycle.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Hazelcast integration enables multi-node deployments with automatic cluster discovery.
 * When Hazelcast is not configured, the helper operates in single-node mode.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Example usage:
 * <pre>{@code
 * if (ClusterHelper.isMaster()) {
 *     // Schedule cluster-wide job
 * }
 * }</pre>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Warning:</b> Static methods return null or default values before the Spring
 * {@code @PostConstruct} initialization completes. Ensure Spring context is fully
 * loaded before accessing cluster information.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Thread Safety:</b> Static methods read instance fields that are set once during
 * startup. Safe for concurrent access after initialization.
