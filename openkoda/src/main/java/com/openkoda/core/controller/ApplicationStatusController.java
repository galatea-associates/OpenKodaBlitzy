/**
 * Lightweight Spring REST controller exposing a public health and liveness endpoint for monitoring systems.
 * <p>
 * This controller provides a {@code GET /ping} endpoint designed for load balancers, orchestration platforms
 * (such as Kubernetes), and monitoring systems to verify application health. The endpoint performs diagnostic
 * checks on critical system components and returns their status with execution timing metrics.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Response Behavior:</b>
 * <ul>
 * <li>HTTP 200 (OK) - All monitored components are healthy and operational</li>
 * <li>HTTP 503 (SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE) - One or more components have failed health checks</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Security Considerations:</b><br>
 * This endpoint is intentionally public and does NOT require authentication. It returns only non-sensitive
 * diagnostic information suitable for exposure to monitoring infrastructure. Do not add checks that reveal
 * sensitive system details or credentials.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Response Format:</b><br>
 * The endpoint returns a {@link LinkedHashMap} preserving insertion order with per-component status:
 * <pre>{@code
 * {
 *   "db": "OK",           // Database connectivity status
 *   "dbTime": "45"        // Database check execution time in milliseconds
 * }
 * }</pre>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Example Load Balancer Configuration (HAProxy):</b>
 * <pre>{@code
 * option httpchk GET /ping
 * http-check expect status 200
 * }</pre>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Example Kubernetes Liveness Probe:</b>
 * <pre>{@code
 * livenessProbe:
 *   httpGet:
 *     path: /ping
 *     port: 8080
 *   initialDelaySeconds: 30
 *   periodSeconds: 10
 * }</pre>
 * </p>

     * Wraps a health check operation with execution time measurement and exception handling.
     * <p>
     * This utility method executes the provided health check supplier, measures its execution time
     * using {@link System#currentTimeMillis()}, and records both the status and timing in the
     * diagnostic log map. Any exceptions thrown during execution are caught and converted to an
     * "ERROR" status, ensuring the health check endpoint remains stable even when components fail.

     * <li>On success: Records status as "OK" in the log map</li>
     * <li>On exception: Records status as "ERROR" in the log map</li>
     * <li>Always records execution time as "{@code <entryName>Time}" in milliseconds</li>

     * // diagnostics now contains: {"db": "OK", "dbTime": "42"}
     * }</pre>
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * This method is designed for use within the {@link #ping(HttpServletResponse)} endpoint to
     * uniformly measure and report health check execution across all monitored components.
     * </p>
     *
     * @param entryName the component name used as the key in the diagnostic map; status is stored
     *                  under this key and timing under "{@code <entryName>Time}"
     * @param log the diagnostic map where status ("OK"/"ERROR") and timing (milliseconds as string)
     *            are recorded; must be mutable and non-null
     * @param f the health check supplier to execute; exceptions are caught and treated as failures;
     *          return value is ignored (only successful execution matters)
     * @return {@code true} if the health check executed successfully without throwing an exception,
     *         {@code false} if an exception was caught (indicating component failure)
     * @since 1.7.1
