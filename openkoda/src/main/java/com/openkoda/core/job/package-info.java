/**
 * Provides scheduled background job execution for OpenKoda system maintenance and asynchronous task processing.
 * <p>
 * This package manages scheduled background jobs for email delivery, webhook delivery, search index maintenance,
 * and system health monitoring. Jobs run automatically on configurable schedules using Spring's @Scheduled mechanism.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Package Architecture</h2>
 * <p>
 * The JobsScheduler orchestrates four job implementations using Spring @Scheduled annotations. Each job processes
 * tasks from the database in a stateless manner with atomic task claiming and transactional execution.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Key Components</h2>
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>JobsScheduler</b>: Central scheduling orchestrator that uses @Scheduled annotations to trigger job execution
 *     at configured intervals</li>
 * <li><b>EmailSenderJob</b>: Processes Email tasks from the database and sends messages via the EmailSender service.
 *     Runs every 5 seconds using fixedDelay scheduling</li>
 * <li><b>PostMessagesToWebhookJob</b>: Processes HttpRequestTask entities and posts messages to webhook URLs via
 *     RestTemplate. Runs every 5 seconds using fixedDelay scheduling</li>
 * <li><b>SearchIndexUpdaterJob</b>: Updates search_index columns for searchable entities using native SQL queries.
 *     Runs every 10 seconds using fixedDelay scheduling</li>
 * <li><b>SystemHealthAlertJob</b>: Monitors RAM, CPU, and disk usage against configurable thresholds and sends alerts.
 *     Runs daily at 4:00 AM by default using cron scheduling</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Scheduling Patterns</h2>
 * <p>
 * Jobs use two scheduling patterns:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>Fixed Delay</b>: Jobs wait for a specified delay after the previous execution completes before starting again.
 *     Used for EmailSenderJob and PostMessagesToWebhookJob (5 second delay) and SearchIndexUpdaterJob (10 second delay)</li>
 * <li><b>Cron Expression</b>: Jobs run at specific times defined by cron syntax. Used for SystemHealthAlertJob
 *     (default: 0 0 4 * * ? for daily 4:00 AM execution)</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Design Patterns</h2>
 * <p>
 * <b>Atomic Task Claiming</b>: Jobs use repository-based findTasksAndSetStateDoing() methods to atomically claim tasks
 * and set their state to DOING. This prevents duplicate processing when multiple application instances run concurrently.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Transactional Execution</b>: All job methods are marked @Transactional, ensuring that database changes either
 * commit together or roll back together. If a job throws an exception, the transaction rolls back and tasks remain
 * ready for retry.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Request Tracing</b>: All jobs implement LoggingComponentWithRequestId for request-id-aware logging, enabling
 * trace correlation across distributed operations.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Configuration Properties</h2>
 * <p>
 * Spring configuration requirements:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li><code>@EnableScheduling</code> must be enabled in application configuration</li>
 * <li><code>scheduled.systemHealth.check</code>: Cron expression for system health checks (default: 0 0 4 * * ?)</li>
 * <li><code>max.disk.percentage</code>: Disk usage threshold percentage (default: 75)</li>
 * <li><code>max.ram.percentage</code>: RAM usage threshold percentage (default: 75)</li>
 * <li><code>max.cpu.percentage</code>: CPU usage threshold percentage (default: 75)</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Usage Example</h2>
 * <pre>{@code
 * // Jobs execute automatically via Spring scheduler
 * // Manual execution example (for testing):
 * List<Email> tasks = emailRepository.findTasksAndSetStateDoing(10);
 * tasks.forEach(email -> emailSender.sendEmail(email));
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <h2>Thread Safety</h2>
 * <p>
 * Jobs are stateless Spring beans with no instance variables. The Spring scheduler uses a default single-threaded
 * executor, preventing concurrent execution of the same job. Database-level locking via findTasksAndSetStateDoing()
 * prevents task duplication across multiple application instances.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Error Handling</h2>
 * <p>
 * When a job throws an exception, Spring's scheduler propagates the exception causing the transaction to roll back.
 * Failed tasks remain in a ready state and are retried on the next scheduled execution. This ensures no task is lost
 * due to transient failures.
 * </p>
