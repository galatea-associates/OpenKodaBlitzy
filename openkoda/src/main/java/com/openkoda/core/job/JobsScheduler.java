/**
 * Central orchestrator for all scheduled background jobs in the OpenKoda platform.
 * <p>
 * This Spring component wires together four job implementations and provides scheduling
 * orchestration using Spring's {@code @Scheduled} annotation. The scheduler uses two
 * timing strategies: fixed-delay intervals for continuous jobs (email, webhook, search)
 * and cron expressions for periodic jobs (system health checks).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * All scheduled methods are stateless delegates that pass control to injected job beans.
 * Actual concurrency control, transaction management, and error handling are implemented
 * within the individual job classes. This separation ensures the scheduler remains simple
 * and focused solely on timing orchestration.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This class implements {@link LoggingComponentWithRequestId} to enable request-id-aware
 * tracing for all scheduled job executions, facilitating debugging and audit trails.
 * </p>
