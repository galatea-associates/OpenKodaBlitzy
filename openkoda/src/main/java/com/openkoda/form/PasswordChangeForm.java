 * Request-scoped form for password change operations.
 * <p>
 * This form provides a lightweight DTO for password change requests, using Jakarta Bean Validation
 * for declarative constraint enforcement. The form binds the target user identifier and new password
 * for validation before applying password changes to the user entity.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The form uses the {@code @NotBlank} constraint on the password field to ensure that password
 * changes always provide a non-empty value. The userId field identifies the target user whose
 * password is being changed.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Usage example:
 * <pre>
 * PasswordChangeForm form = new PasswordChangeForm(userId);
 * form.setPassword("newPassword123");
 * // Validate using Spring's BindingResult and apply changes
 * </pre>
