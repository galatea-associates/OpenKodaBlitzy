/**
 * Enumeration defining organization creation strategies for distinguishing between creating new organizations versus assigning existing ones.
 * <p>
 * This enum serves as a compile-time, type-safe token for branching logic and API payloads throughout the OpenKoda platform.
 * It is used in DTOs, controllers, services, and persisted payloads where enum serialization is supported. The enum provides
 * a clear semantic distinction between two fundamental organization operations: creating a brand new tenant with full provisioning
 * versus associating a user or resource with an existing tenant without any new tenant creation.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Thread Safety: This enum contains only immutable constants and is inherently thread-safe. All constants are initialized
 * at class loading time and share no mutable state.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Runtime Characteristics: The enum has minimal runtime footprint with no additional fields or behavior beyond the standard
 * enum mechanics. Changing this enum's public API or removing constants will break callers and serialized consumers.
 * </p>
