/**
 * Provides multi-tenant organization provisioning and lifecycle management services.
 * <p>
 * This package contains services responsible for creating, managing, and deleting tenant organizations
 * within OpenKoda's multi-tenancy architecture. Organizations serve as the root entity in the tenant
 * hierarchy, with all tenant-scoped data linked via organization_id foreign keys.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Key Services</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code OrganizationService} - Core service for organization CRUD operations, tenant provisioning,
 *       and cascade deletion of organization-scoped resources</li>
 *   <li>{@code OrganizationCreationStrategy} - Enumeration defining organization creation strategies
 *       (with or without initial data setup)</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Multi-Tenancy Architecture</h2>
 * <p>
 * Organizations form the foundation of OpenKoda's multi-tenancy isolation:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Tenant Hierarchy Root</b>: Organization entity serves as the top-level tenant container,
 *       with all tenant-specific entities linked via organization_id foreign key relationships</li>
 *   <li><b>FK Pattern</b>: Tenant-scoped entities use organization_id columns to enforce data isolation
 *       at the database level</li>
 *   <li><b>Secure Repository Enforcement</b>: All repository queries automatically filter by current
 *       organization context through SecureRepository wrappers</li>
 *   <li><b>Dynamic Entities</b>: Runtime-generated entities are automatically provisioned as
 *       tenant-aware with organization_id columns</li>
 *   <li><b>Tenant Resolution</b>: MultitenancyService resolves the current organization context
 *       from request attributes or authentication tokens</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Organization Lifecycle</h2>
 * <p>
 * Organization provisioning involves schema setup, initial role creation, privilege assignment,
 * and optional seed data population. Organization deletion cascades to all dependent tenant resources
 * including users, roles, dynamic entities, and file storage.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Usage Example</h2>
 * <pre>{@code
 * OrganizationService orgService = ...;
 * Organization tenant = orgService.createOrganization("TenantCo");
 * }</pre>
