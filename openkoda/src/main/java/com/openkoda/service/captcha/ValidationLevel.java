/**
 * Enumeration of reCAPTCHA validation strictness levels for configurable bot protection.
 * <p>
 * This enum defines threshold levels for reCAPTCHA score evaluation, allowing per-endpoint
 * configuration of bot detection strictness. The validation levels balance security requirements
 * against user experience, with higher strictness reducing false negatives (bots passing
 * verification) but potentially increasing false positives (legitimate users failing verification).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The validation behavior differs between reCAPTCHA v2 (checkbox-based) and v3 (score-based):
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>none</b>: No validation performed - suitable for development/testing environments</li>
 *   <li><b>normal</b>: Balanced validation with moderate security (v3 score ≥ 0.5, v2 checkbox required)</li>
 *   <li><b>strict</b>: High security validation with stricter thresholds (v3 score ≥ 0.7, v2 checkbox required)</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Configuration can be set globally via application properties or overridden per-endpoint:
 * <pre>{@code
 * // Per-endpoint override
 * captchaService.verify(token, ValidationLevel.strict);
 * }</pre>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Use case guidance:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>none</b>: Local development, automated testing, internal administrative tools</li>
 *   <li><b>normal</b>: Standard user-facing forms (registration, contact forms, comments)</li>
 *   <li><b>strict</b>: High-security endpoints (admin login, financial transactions, password resets)</li>
 * </ul>

 * @see CaptchaService for usage in verification workflow
