/**
 * Autocomplete service specialized for form field expressions and validation rules.
 * <p>
 * This service provides intelligent code completion suggestions for developers working with
 * OpenKoda's form definition system. It extracts method signatures and documentation from
 * form builder classes to support interactive form design and validation rule editing.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Form-specific features include:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Entity field paths for data binding</li>
 *   <li>Validation expressions and built-in validators</li>
 *   <li>Data binding paths for entity property mapping</li>
 *   <li>Thymeleaf expressions for dynamic rendering</li>
 *   <li>Form lifecycle methods (populateFrom, validate, populateTo)</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Primary use cases:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Form Designer - Autocomplete when building form field definitions</li>
 *   <li>Validation Editor - Suggest validation rules and expressions</li>
 *   <li>Binding Editor - Suggest entity property paths for data binding</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This service is a stateless Spring singleton managed by component scanning via the
 * {@code @Service} annotation. It uses reflection to dynamically extract method information
 * from form builder classes, ensuring suggestions stay current with API changes.
 * </p>
