/**
 * Generic interface defining contract for converting domain entities into YAML-oriented export artifacts.
 * <p>
 * This interface provides the foundation for serializing OpenKoda entities to portable YAML format
 * for export/import operations, backup procedures, and cross-environment data migration. Implementations
 * handle entity-to-DTO conversion, ZIP archive generation, and optional database upgrade script generation.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Typical workflow:
 * <pre>{@code
 * EntityToYamlConverter<MyEntity, MyDTO> converter = ...;
 * converter.addToZip(entity, zipOutputStream, existingEntries);
 * }</pre>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Thread Safety:</b> Implementations are responsible for handling concurrency when multiple
 * entities are processed in parallel. Callers should consult the zipEntries Set to avoid duplicate
 * ZIP entries during concurrent operations.
 * </p>
 *
 * @param <T> the entity type to be converted (e.g., Organization, User, Form)
 * @param <D> the DTO type produced during conversion (e.g., OrganizationDto, UserDto)
 * @author OpenKoda Team
 * @version 1.7.1
 * @since 1.7.1
 * @see EntityToYamlConverterFactory
 * @see ZipOutputStream
