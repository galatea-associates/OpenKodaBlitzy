/**
 * Centralized string constants defining folder path conventions for OpenKoda component export/import operations.
 * <p>
 * This class provides classpath-relative and filesystem path fragments used by import/export services to discover
 * YAML component definitions, code resources, and supplemental files. Constants include component category prefixes
 * (server-side, form, scheduler, event), export destination paths for ZIP packaging (code, templates, config,
 * privileges, migration), base paths combining category and COMPONENTS_ prefix, and derived collections
 * (BASE_FILE_PATHS, SUBDIR_FILE_PATHS) for systematic folder scanning.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Usage pattern:</b> Import services scan BASE_FILE_PATHS Ã— SUBDIR_FILE_PATHS cartesian product to discover
 * all component YAML files. Export services construct output paths using EXPORT_*_PATH_ prefixes to package
 * components into distributable ZIP archives.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Thread-safety:</b> All constants are immutable and safe for concurrent access across multiple threads.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Maintenance note:</b> All path fragments include trailing slashes for safe concatenation without additional
 * path separator logic.
 * </p>
 *
 * @see ClasspathComponentImportService for usage in classpath scanning
 * @see ComponentExportService for usage in ZIP packaging
 * @see com.openkoda.model.component.FrontendResource.AccessLevel for SUBDIR_FILE_PATHS derivation
