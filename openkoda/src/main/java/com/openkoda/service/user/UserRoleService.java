/**
 * Junction entity management service for user-role assignments with organization scoping.
 * <p>
 * Manages {@link UserRole} entities that represent the many-to-many relationship between
 * users and roles. This service provides queries for retrieving user-role assignments
 * scoped by organization, supporting the multi-tenant role-based access control system.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The UserRole junction entity contains:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>id - Primary key</li>
 *   <li>userId - Foreign key to User entity</li>
 *   <li>roleId - Foreign key to Role entity</li>
 *   <li>organizationId - Optional foreign key for organization-scoped roles</li>
 * </ul>
 * The entity enforces a unique constraint on (userId, roleId, organizationId) to prevent
 * duplicate role assignments. The createdAt timestamp provides audit trail for assignments.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This stateless service acts as a fa√ßade, isolating callers from direct repository and
 * specification wiring. All operations use secure repositories with privilege enforcement.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Thread-safety: This service is stateless and thread-safe.
 * </p>
