/**
 * User account management, authentication, and authorization services.
 * <p>
 * This package provides comprehensive user lifecycle services for OpenKoda applications. It handles
 * user account creation, authentication token management, role-based access control (RBAC), API key
 * generation for programmatic access, and privilege evaluation. Services in this package coordinate
 * with Spring Security to provide secure authentication and fine-grained authorization.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Key Services</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>UserService</b>: Core user management service providing CRUD operations, password management,
 *       and account status control. Handles user creation, updates, deletion, and password reset workflows.</li>
 *   <li><b>RoleService</b>: Manages role definitions, role assignments to users, and privilege synchronization.
 *       Supports global roles, organization-scoped roles, and role hierarchy.</li>
 *   <li><b>BasicPrivilegeService</b>: Provides cached privilege evaluation for performance. Determines if
 *       a user has specific privileges within organizational contexts.</li>
 *   <li><b>TokenService</b>: Generates and validates JWT and opaque authentication tokens. Manages token
 *       lifecycle including expiration and revocation.</li>
 *   <li><b>ApiKeyService</b>: Manages API key lifecycle for programmatic access to OpenKoda APIs.
 *       Handles key generation, validation, and revocation.</li>
 *   <li><b>UserRoleService</b>: Manages the junction between users and roles. Handles user-role assignments
 *       and removals at both global and organization levels.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Authentication Flows</h2>
 * <p>
 * The package supports multiple authentication mechanisms:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Password Login</b>: UserService validates credentials against stored password hashes.
 *       Upon successful validation, TokenService generates a JWT for subsequent requests.</li>
 *   <li><b>API Key Authentication</b>: ApiKeyService validates API key headers against stored keys.
 *       API keys provide long-lived programmatic access without password exposure.</li>
 *   <li><b>OAuth Integration</b>: External OAuth providers authenticate users. Users are linked
 *       to OpenKoda accounts via Token entities for session management.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Authorization Model</h2>
 * <p>
 * Authorization follows a role-based access control (RBAC) pattern with these components:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>User to Role Mapping</b>: Users are assigned roles through UserRole junction entities.
 *       Roles can be global or organization-scoped.</li>
 *   <li><b>Role to Privilege Mapping</b>: Each Role entity contains a set of Privilege enum values
 *       that define allowed operations.</li>
 *   <li><b>Privilege Evaluation</b>: BasicPrivilegeService checks if a user has required privileges
 *       by traversing User → UserRole → Role → Privileges.</li>
 *   <li><b>Secure Repositories</b>: Data access layer enforces organization-scoped queries automatically,
 *       ensuring users only access data within their organizational context.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Usage Example</h2>
 * <pre>
 * // Create user with role
 * User user = userService.createUser("john@example.com", "password123");
 * roleService.assignRole(user, organizationRole);
 * 
 * // Check privilege
 * boolean canEdit = privilegeService.hasPrivilege(userId, Privilege.EDIT_USER);
 * </pre>
