/**
 * Provides Spring MVC controllers for multi-tenant organization management operations.
 * <p>
 * This package implements the web layer for organization lifecycle management including
 * creation, configuration, member management, and deletion. Organizations represent tenant
 * boundaries in the OpenKoda multi-tenant architecture, providing data isolation and
 * user access control at the tenant level.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Multi-Tenancy Architecture</h2>
 * <p>
 * Organizations serve as the primary tenant entity in OpenKoda's multi-tenant model.
 * Each organization maintains:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Isolated data scope with organization-scoped privileges</li>
 *   <li>Custom property bag (JSONB storage) for tenant-specific configuration</li>
 *   <li>Member roster with role-based access control</li>
 *   <li>Optional dedicated database schema for complete data isolation</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Key Classes</h2>
 * <dl>
 *   <dt>{@link com.openkoda.controller.organization.AbstractOrganizationController}</dt>
 *   <dd>Abstract base controller providing Flow-based business logic for organization
 *       operations including search with pagination, CRUD operations, member management
 *       (invite/remove users), and organization deletion with cascade cleanup. Enforces
 *       organization-scoped privileges via secure repositories.</dd>
 *
 *   <dt>{@link com.openkoda.controller.organization.OrganizationControllerHtml}</dt>
 *   <dd>Concrete Spring MVC controller exposing HTML endpoints for organization management
 *       UI. Extends AbstractOrganizationController and maps HTTP requests to Flow pipelines.
 *       Handles form binding, validation, and ModelAndView rendering. Routes under
 *       /organizations with privilege-based access control.</dd>
 * </dl>
 *
 * <h2>Service Dependencies</h2>
 * <p>
 * Controllers delegate to service layer for business logic execution:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code OrganizationService} - Tenant provisioning, schema management, organization removal</li>
 *   <li>{@code UserService} - Member invitation, user-organization association</li>
 *   <li>{@code UserRoleService} - Role assignment and privilege reconciliation</li>
 *   <li>{@code ValidationService} - Form validation and business rule enforcement</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Repository Access</h2>
 * <p>
 * Data access uses both secure and unsecure repository patterns:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code repositories.secure.organization} - Privilege-enforcing organization queries</li>
 *   <li>{@code repositories.unsecure.organization} - Administrative operations bypassing privilege checks</li>
 *   <li>{@code repositories.unsecure.user} - User lookup for member management</li>
 *   <li>{@code repositories.unsecure.role} - Global role retrieval for assignment</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Typical Usage Patterns</h2>
 * <p>
 * Organization CRUD workflow:
 * </p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * // Create organization with initial admin user
 * services.organization.createOrganization(form.getName());
 *
 * // Update organization properties
 * services.organization.saveOrganization(organization);
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * Member management workflow:
 * </p>
 * <pre>{@code
 * // Invite user to organization
 * services.user.inviteNewOrExistingUser(email, organizationId, roleName);
 *
 * // Remove user from organization
 * services.user.removeUserRole(userRoleId);
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <h2>Package Guidelines</h2>
 * <p>
 * <b>Should I put a class into this package?</b>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Yes, if the class is a Spring MVC controller implementing HTTP endpoints for organization
 * management operations. Controllers should extend AbstractOrganizationController and focus
 * on request/response handling while delegating business logic to the service layer.
