/**
 * Abstract base controller providing Flow-based helper methods for system health monitoring,
 * database validation, and server-side JavaScript thread management.
 * <p>
 * Stateless abstract controller implementing system diagnostics and monitoring functionality.
 * Provides system health status collection ({@link #getSystemHealth()}), database schema validation
 * ({@link #validate()}), GraalVM JS thread listing ({@link #getThreads()}), and thread lifecycle
 * management ({@link #interruptThread(Long)}, {@link #removeThread(Long)}). Designed for reuse by
 * concrete controllers that handle HTTP bindings and view resolution for admin monitoring dashboards.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * System health context: Monitors JVM metrics (memory, threads, CPU), database connection status,
 * and cache hit rates via {@code services.systemStatus}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Database validation: Generates DDL update scripts for schema drift detection via
 * {@code services.databaseValidationService}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * JavaScript thread management: Controls server-side GraalVM JS execution threads via
 * {@link ServerJSProcessRunner} singleton.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Thread-safety: Stateless, thread-safe. {@link ServerJSProcessRunner} operations are
 * synchronized internally.
 * </p>
