/**
 * REST API v2 controller providing JSON CRUD endpoints for ServerJs entities.
 * <p>
 * This controller is a mirror-pattern adapter for the ServerJs domain. It extends
 * {@code CRUDApiController<ServerJs>} and exposes standard CRUD operations under
 * dual request mapping paths: an organization-scoped path composed from
 * {@code _API_V2_ORGANIZATION_ORGANIZATIONID + _SERVERJS} and a global v2 path
 * composed from {@code _API_V2 + _SERVERJS}. The controller is a stateless adapter
 * with no additional methods or fields beyond the inherited functionality.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The constructor calls {@code super(SERVERJS)} to pass the logical resource identifier
 * constant into the base {@link CRUDApiController}. All CRUD operations are inherited
 * from the parent controller, and this class exists solely to register routes and bind
 * the generic CRUD implementation to the ServerJs domain type and canonical URL constants.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <h3>Request Mapping Base Paths</h3>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Organization-scoped: {@code /api/v2/{organizationId}/server-js}</li>
 *   <li>Global v2: {@code /api/v2/server-js}</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <h3>Inherited Endpoints</h3>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code GET /api/v2/server-js/all} - List ServerJs scripts with pagination</li>
 *   <li>{@code GET /api/v2/server-js/{id}} - Get single ServerJs script by ID</li>
 *   <li>{@code POST /api/v2/server-js/create} - Create new ServerJs from JSON</li>
 *   <li>{@code POST /api/v2/server-js/{id}/update} - Update existing script</li>
 *   <li>{@code POST /api/v2/server-js/{id}/remove} - Delete script</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <h3>API Response Format</h3>
 * <p>
 * All endpoints return JSON responses wrapped in standard API result structure:
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 * // List response
 * {"success": true, "data": [{"id": 1, "name": "script.js"}]}
 * 
 * // Single response
 * {"success": true, "data": {"id": 1, "name": "script.js", "code": "..."}}
 * 
 * // Create/update response
 * {"success": true, "data": {"id": 2, "name": "new-script.js"}}
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <h3>Security</h3>
 * <p>
 * All endpoints require authentication and are subject to authorization checks. Multi-tenancy
 * is enforced through organization-scoped paths when the {@code organizationId} path variable
 * is present. Unauthorized requests return HTTP 401 or 403 status codes.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <h3>Operational Considerations</h3>
 * <p>
 * Removing, renaming, or changing the package of this class will break compile-time references
 * and prevent Spring from registering the endpoints. Altering {@code @RequestMapping} values
 * changes the API contract. Changing the constant passed to {@code super(...)} can break
 * base-controller binding including resource resolution, permissions, and logging. Maintain
 * compatibility when evolving URL constants or {@link CRUDApiController} APIs. Coordinate
 * changes with configuration updates and testing.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <h3>Maintainability</h3>
 * <p>
 * This class is a low-risk routing adapter but critical to the public API surface for v2.
 * Include it in CI regression suites and API contract tests. Changes to this controller
 * should be accompanied by updates to integration tests, API documentation, and release notes.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <h3>Thread Safety</h3>
 * <p>
 * Stateless singleton - thread-safe. Each request creates a new Flow pipeline for execution.
 * </p>

 * @see ServerJs
 * @since 1.7.1
 * @version 1.7.1
