/**
 * RestController providing REST API v1 endpoints for Organization entity CRUD operations.
 * <p>
 * This controller is a minimal declarative adapter extending {@code CRUDApiController<Organization>}.
 * It is marked as {@code @Deprecated}, indicating a planned migration to a newer API version.
 * Coordinate with all API clients before removing this controller to prevent service disruptions.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The controller exposes organization CRUD operations under two URL paths for flexibility:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code /api/v1/{organizationId}/organization} - Organization-scoped routes for operations within a specific organization context</li>
 *   <li>{@code /api/v1/organization} - Collection-scoped routes for operations across organizations</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The controller is stateless with no additional methods beyond the inherited CRUD functionality.
 * All CRUD operations are provided by the parent {@link CRUDApiController} class.
 * The constructor calls {@code super(ORGANIZATION)} to bind the controller to the ORGANIZATION resource configuration.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Inherited endpoints include:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>GET /all - List all organizations</li>
 *   <li>GET /{id} - Retrieve organization details by ID</li>
 *   <li>POST /create - Create a new organization</li>
 *   <li>POST /{id}/update - Update an existing organization</li>
 *   <li>POST /{id}/remove - Delete an organization</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
