/**
 * Concrete implementation of CRUD controller configuration registry for REST API endpoints.
 * <p>
 * Spring {@code @Component} extending {@link AbstractCRUDControllerConfigurationMap}.
 * Stores configurations for API-based generic CRUD controllers (CRUDApiController).
 * Configurations are registered at application startup via CRUDControllers.
 * Used by API controllers to retrieve entity-specific settings including repository,
 * form class, and required privileges for JSON REST endpoints.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Thread-safety: Extends HashMap with no additional synchronization. Assumes
 * single-threaded startup registration during {@code @PostConstruct} phase.
