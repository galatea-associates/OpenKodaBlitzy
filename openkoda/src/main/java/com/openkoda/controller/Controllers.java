 * Spring bean aggregator providing centralized access to controller instances and configuration maps.

 * Convenience registry collecting common controller beans and CRUD configuration maps for easy injection.

 * controller lookup. Used by controllers needing inter-controller communication or configuration access.

 * Example usage:
 * <pre>
 * {@code @Autowired Controllers controllers;
 * CRUDControllerConfiguration config = controllers.htmlCrudControllerConfigurationMap.get("users");}
