/**
 * Service for loading initial integration data and bootstrapping integration module during application startup.
 * <p>
 * This service implements an event listener for {@link CoreSettledEvent} that executes after the core
 * application context is fully initialized. It loads default configurations and registers privilege
 * definitions for the integration module.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * During startup, this service seeds module privileges into the administrator role by collecting
 * all values from {@code IntegrationPrivilege.values()} into a Set and calling
 * {@code services.module.addModulePrivilegesToRole(ROLE_ADMIN, privilegesSet)}.
 * This ensures administrators have access to all integration features immediately after deployment.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Execution is guarded by {@link SpringProfilesHelper#isInitializationProfile()} to run only during
 * initialization profiles. This prevents duplicate privilege seeding on subsequent application restarts.
 * Disabling this service prevents automatic privilege seeding and requires manual role updates.
 * </p>
