/**
 * Common controller utilities for the integration module including page attributes, URL constants, and shared controller components.
 * <p>
 * This package provides centralized routing keys and model binding descriptors used by IntegrationControllerHtml
 * and Thymeleaf views. It contains interface-based constant definitions that establish consistent naming conventions
 * for integration-related endpoints and page model attributes.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Key classes include IntegrationPageAttributes for typed model descriptors used in integration form binding,
 * and IntegrationURLConstants for URL path constants that define integration routing patterns.
 * These artifacts ensure type-safe access to model attributes and URL paths across the integration controller layer.
 * </p>
