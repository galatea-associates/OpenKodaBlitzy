/**
 * Integration configuration models for third-party service integrations.
 * <p>
 * This package provides configuration management at two levels: global settings from
 * application.properties and per-organization settings from database storage. These models
 * enable both system-wide and tenant-specific integration credentials and settings.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Key Classes</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>IntegrationModuleGlobalConfiguration</b> - Spring-managed configuration bean that
 *       loads global integration settings from application.properties. This provides default
 *       values and system-wide credentials for integrations like OAuth providers, API keys,
 *       and service endpoints.</li>
 *   <li><b>IntegrationModuleOrganizationConfiguration</b> - JPA entity that stores
 *       tenant-scoped integration credentials in the database. Each organization can maintain
 *       its own API keys, OAuth client IDs, and custom integration parameters, enabling
 *       multi-tenancy support for third-party services.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Usage Context</h2>
 * <p>
 * These configuration models are used throughout the integration subsystem to manage
 * credentials and settings for:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>OAuth authentication flows with providers like GitHub, Google, and Microsoft</li>
 *   <li>Third-party service integrations including Trello, Jira, and Basecamp</li>
 *   <li>REST API consumers requiring authentication tokens or API keys</li>
 *   <li>Per-organization customization of integration behavior and credentials</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Global configurations provide fallback defaults, while organization-specific configurations
 * override these values when tenant-scoped credentials are required. This two-tier approach
 * supports both single-tenant and multi-tenant deployment scenarios.
 * </p>
