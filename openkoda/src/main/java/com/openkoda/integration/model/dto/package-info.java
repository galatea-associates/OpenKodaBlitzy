/**
 * Data transfer objects for integration configuration form binding and validation.
 * <p>
 * This package contains lightweight mutable POJOs used for Spring MVC property binding,
 * Jackson serialization, and controller/service layer data transfer. Each DTO represents
 * configuration data for third-party service integrations including Basecamp, GitHub,
 * Jira, Microsoft Teams, Slack, and Trello.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>JavaBean Pattern</h2>
 * <p>
 * All DTOs in this package follow the JavaBean pattern with public fields, getters/setters,
 * and implicit no-argument constructors. This design enables automatic property binding in
 * Spring MVC controllers and seamless JSON serialization via Jackson ObjectMapper.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Thread-Safety Considerations</h2>
 * <p>
 * DTOs are mutable and not thread-safe by design. They are intended for single-threaded
 * request processing within controller and service methods. Callers must enforce concurrency
 * control if DTOs are shared across threads or stored in shared caches.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Sensitive Field Handling</h2>
 * <p>
 * DTOs contain sensitive credentials including webhook URLs, API keys, and authentication
 * tokens. Follow these security practices:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Store credentials in secure secret management systems (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)</li>
 *   <li>Avoid logging DTO contents in plaintext</li>
 *   <li>Redact sensitive fields in diagnostic outputs</li>
 *   <li>Use HTTPS for all data transmission</li>
 *   <li>Apply role-based access control to configuration endpoints</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Usage Patterns</h2>
 * <p>
 * DTOs serve three primary purposes in the integration layer:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Form Binding:</b> Capture user input from Spring MVC controllers via @ModelAttribute</li>
 *   <li><b>JSON Serialization:</b> Convert between Java objects and JSON via Jackson for REST APIs</li>
 *   <li><b>Data Transfer:</b> Pass configuration data between controller, service, and repository layers</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Example usage:
 * <pre>
 * GitHubIntegrationDto dto = new GitHubIntegrationDto();
 * dto.setApiKey(secretsManager.getGitHubKey());
 * </pre>
 * </p>
