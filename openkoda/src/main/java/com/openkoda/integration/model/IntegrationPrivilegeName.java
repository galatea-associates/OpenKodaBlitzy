/**
 * String constants for integration privilege tokens used in {@code @PreAuthorize} annotations and security checks.
 * <p>
 * This interface defines privilege name constants that control access to third-party integration features
 * within the OpenKoda platform. Each constant represents a permission token that is evaluated during
 * runtime security checks to determine if a user or organization has authorization to access specific
 * integration endpoints and functionality.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * These constants are designed for compile-time inlining in security expressions. When used in Spring
 * Security's {@code @PreAuthorize} annotations, they ensure type-safe and consistent privilege checking
 * across integration controllers and services. The underscore prefix naming convention distinguishes
 * these static final String constants from method-level security expressions.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Example usage in security contexts:
 * <pre>{@code
 * @PreAuthorize("hasAuthority(T(com.openkoda.integration.model.IntegrationPrivilegeName)._canIntegrateWithSlack)")
 * public ResponseEntity<String> slackCallback() { ... }
 * }</pre>
