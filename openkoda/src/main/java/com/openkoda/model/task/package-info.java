/**
 * Background task system entities for asynchronous job execution in OpenKoda.
 * <p>
 * This package provides JPA entity models for scheduling, tracking, and executing
 * background tasks asynchronously. Tasks are persisted to the database and processed
 * by background workers, enabling reliable execution of long-running operations
 * without blocking HTTP request threads.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Task Architecture</h2>
 * <p>
 * The task system uses JPA single-table inheritance with {@link com.openkoda.model.task.Task}
 * as the abstract base entity. All task types share the 'tasks' table and are differentiated
 * by a 'type' discriminator column. This design provides:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Unified task scheduling and lifecycle management</li>
 *   <li>Consistent retry logic across all task types</li>
 *   <li>Efficient querying via single-table storage</li>
 *   <li>Extensibility through polymorphic task subclasses</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Key Task Entities</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link com.openkoda.model.task.Task} - Abstract base entity defining common task lifecycle,
 *       retry logic, organization scoping, and state management (NEW/DOING/DONE/FAILED/FAILED_PERMANENTLY)</li>
 *   <li>{@link com.openkoda.model.task.Email} - Email sending task with recipient metadata, HTML content,
 *       file attachments, and SMTP/Mailgun integration. Executed by {@link com.openkoda.core.job.EmailSenderJob}</li>
 *   <li>{@link com.openkoda.model.task.HttpRequestTask} - HTTP request execution task for webhooks and
 *       external API calls with JSON payloads, custom headers, and response capture</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Task Lifecycle</h2>
 * <p>
 * Tasks progress through the following states:
 * </p>
 * <ol>
 *   <li><strong>NEW</strong> - Task created and ready for execution when startAfter time is reached</li>
 *   <li><strong>DOING</strong> - Task currently executing by background worker</li>
 *   <li><strong>DONE</strong> - Task completed successfully, no further action needed</li>
 *   <li><strong>FAILED</strong> - Task execution failed but can retry (attempts &lt; maxAttempts)</li>
 *   <li><strong>FAILED_PERMANENTLY</strong> - Task exhausted retry attempts, manual intervention required</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <h2>Task Scheduling</h2>
 * <p>
 * Tasks are scheduled using the {@code startAfter} field (LocalDateTime). Background workers
 * query for startable tasks using the computed {@code canBeStarted} field, which evaluates:
 * {@code current_timestamp > start_after AND (state = 'NEW' OR state = 'FAILED')}
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This DB-side computation enables efficient task selection without loading all tasks into memory.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Retry Strategy</h2>
 * <p>
 * Failed tasks are automatically retried up to {@code MAX_ATTEMPTS_DEFAULT} (5 attempts).
 * The retry workflow:
 * </p>
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Task execution fails, {@link com.openkoda.model.task.Task#fail()} called</li>
 *   <li>If attempts &lt; maxAttempts: state → FAILED, task remains eligible for retry</li>
 *   <li>If attempts &gt;= maxAttempts: state → FAILED_PERMANENTLY, no further retries</li>
 *   <li>Background worker re-selects FAILED tasks via canBeStarted formula</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * Exponential backoff can be implemented by updating {@code startAfter} in {@code fail()} method.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Multi-Tenancy Support</h2>
 * <p>
 * All task entities implement {@link com.openkoda.model.common.AuditableEntityOrganizationRelated},
 * providing organization-scoped task isolation. Each task has:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code organizationId} - Scalar column for write operations and indexing</li>
 *   <li>{@code organization} - ManyToOne association for lazy-loading Organization entity</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Background workers should filter tasks by organizationId to maintain tenant isolation.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Integration with Background Workers</h2>
 * <p>
 * Task execution is coordinated by background job schedulers in {@link com.openkoda.core.job}.
 * Workers query for eligible tasks, execute them, and update state:
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 * Task task = taskRepository.findStartableTask();
 * task.start();  // State: NEW → DOING, attempts++
 * try {
 *     executeTask(task);
 *     task.complete();  // State: DOING → DONE
 * } catch (Exception e) {
 *     task.fail();  // State: DOING → FAILED or FAILED_PERMANENTLY
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Task Monitoring</h2>
 * <p>
 * Task execution can be monitored through:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Task state: Query tasks by state to identify pending/failed tasks</li>
 *   <li>Attempt count: Identify tasks requiring attention (high attempts)</li>
 *   <li>Timestamps: Inherited {@code createdOn}/{@code modifiedOn} from {@link com.openkoda.model.common.TimestampedEntity}</li>
 *   <li>Audit trail: {@code toAuditString()} and {@code contentProperties()} for searchable content</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Integration with Scheduler</h2>
 * <p>
 * For recurring tasks, integrate with {@link com.openkoda.model.Scheduler} entity which
 * defines cron-based schedules for periodic task creation. The scheduler creates new Task
 * instances at configured intervals.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Database Schema</h2>
 * <p>
 * Tasks table structure:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>id</strong> - Primary key (sequence-generated, organization-related ID range)</li>
 *   <li><strong>type</strong> - Discriminator column ('email', 'httprequest', etc.)</li>
 *   <li><strong>state</strong> - Task lifecycle state (VARCHAR, enum values)</li>
 *   <li><strong>attempts</strong> - Retry attempt counter (INT)</li>
 *   <li><strong>start_after</strong> - Scheduled execution time (TIMESTAMP)</li>
 *   <li><strong>organization_id</strong> - Tenant scope (BIGINT, nullable)</li>
 *   <li><strong>created_on</strong> - Creation timestamp (inherited from TimestampedEntity)</li>
 *   <li><strong>modified_on</strong> - Last modification timestamp (inherited)</li>
 *   <li>Type-specific columns for Email and HttpRequestTask subclasses</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Thread Safety</h2>
 * <p>
 * Task state mutations ({@code start()}, {@code fail()}, {@code complete()}) are not
 * internally synchronized. Thread safety relies on:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>JPA transaction isolation preventing concurrent modifications</li>
 *   <li>Background worker coordination to prevent duplicate task execution</li>
 *   <li>Database-level locking when selecting tasks for execution</li>
 * </ul>
