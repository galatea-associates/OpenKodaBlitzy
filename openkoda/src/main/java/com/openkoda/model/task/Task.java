/**
 * Abstract base entity for background job execution and asynchronous task processing.
 * <p>
 * This class provides the foundation for implementing scheduled and asynchronous tasks within OpenKoda.
 * Tasks support automatic retry logic with exponential backoff, multi-tenant isolation, and polymorphic
 * task types through JPA single-table inheritance.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>JPA Mapping</h3>
 * <p>
 * Persisted to {@code tasks} table using {@code @Inheritance(strategy=SINGLE_TABLE)} with
 * {@code @DiscriminatorColumn(name="type")} for polymorphic task types. Concrete subclasses include
 * {@link Email} and {@link HttpRequestTask}, differentiated by discriminator values.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>Task Lifecycle</h3>
 * <p>
 * Tasks progress through the following state transitions:
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 * NEW → DOING → DONE (successful completion)
 *           ↓
 *         FAILED → (retry) → DOING
 *           ↓
 *     FAILED_PERMANENTLY (max attempts exceeded)
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h3>Execution Workflow</h3>
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Task created with state=NEW and scheduled startAfter time</li>
 *   <li>Background worker queries for tasks where {@code canBeStarted=true}</li>
 *   <li>Worker calls {@link #start()} to transition to DOING state</li>
 *   <li>Task executes business logic in subclass implementation</li>
 *   <li>On success: {@link #complete()} transitions to DONE</li>
 *   <li>On failure: {@link #fail()} transitions to FAILED (retriable) or FAILED_PERMANENTLY</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <h3>Retry Logic</h3>
 * <p>
 * Failed tasks automatically retry up to {@code MAX_ATTEMPTS_DEFAULT} (5 attempts) times. After each
 * failure, the task transitions to FAILED state and becomes eligible for retry when {@code canBeStarted}
 * evaluates to true. Tasks exceeding maximum retry attempts transition to FAILED_PERMANENTLY and will
 * not be retried.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>Multi-Tenancy</h3>
 * <p>
 * Implements {@link AuditableEntityOrganizationRelated} for organization-scoped task isolation. Tasks
 * are associated with an {@link Organization} via {@code organizationId} field for write operations
 * and {@code organization} relation for read operations.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>Task Scheduling</h3>
 * <p>
 * The {@code startAfter} field controls execution timing. Tasks become eligible for execution when
 * {@code current_timestamp > startAfter} and state is NEW or FAILED. This eligibility is computed
 * via {@code @Formula} for efficient database-side filtering.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>Thread Safety</h3>
 * <p>
 * State mutations ({@link #start()}, {@link #fail()}, {@link #complete()}) are not synchronized and
 * rely on JPA transaction isolation. Concurrent execution of the same task should be prevented by
 * background worker coordination mechanisms.
 * </p>
