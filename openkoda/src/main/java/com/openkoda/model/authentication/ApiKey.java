/**
 * JPA entity for programmatic API key authentication credentials.
 * <p>
 * This entity enables machine-to-machine authentication for REST API access without
 * requiring username/password credentials. API keys are BCrypt-encoded for security
 * and are excluded from JSON serialization and audit logs to prevent exposure.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Persisted to 'api_key' table with a shared primary key relationship to the User entity,
 * establishing a one-to-one association via the {@code @MapsId} pattern. This ensures
 * each API key is uniquely associated with exactly one User account.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Security considerations:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>API keys are BCrypt-encoded via static PasswordEncoder</li>
 *   <li>{@code @JsonIgnore} annotations prevent JSON exposure of sensitive fields</li>
 *   <li>API key field is excluded from audit logs via {@link #ignorePropertiesInAudit()}</li>
 * </ul>

 * <p>
 * Thread-safety note: The static {@code passwordEncoder} initialization is not synchronized,
 * creating a potential startup ordering dependency. Ensure {@link #setPasswordEncoderOnce(PasswordEncoder)}
 * is called during application initialization before any ApiKey instances are created.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * {@code @DynamicUpdate} annotation enables Hibernate optimization to update only modified
 * columns in UPDATE statements, reducing database overhead.
