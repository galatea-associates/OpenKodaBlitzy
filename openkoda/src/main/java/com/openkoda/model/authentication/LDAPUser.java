/**
 * JPA entity representing LDAP/Active Directory authentication provider integration.

 * This entity enables enterprise Single Sign-On (SSO) authentication by linking LDAP
 * directory identities to OpenKoda User accounts. It stores standard LDAP schema
 * attributes synchronized from directory server responses during authentication.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The entity uses a shared primary key relationship with the {@link User} entity via
 * the {@code @MapsId} annotation, ensuring each LDAP user corresponds to exactly one
 * OpenKoda user account. The {@code @DynamicUpdate} annotation optimizes database
 * operations by updating only modified columns rather than all fields.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Persisted to the {@code ldap_users} table with one-to-one relationship to the
 * {@code users} table through the {@code user_id} foreign key.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Common LDAP attributes stored include:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code cn} (Common Name) - typically the full name</li>
 *   <li>{@code email} - email address from the mail attribute</li>
 *   <li>{@code givenName} - first name</li>
 *   <li>{@code sn} - surname (last name)</li>
 *   <li>{@code uid} - unique username/login identifier</li>
