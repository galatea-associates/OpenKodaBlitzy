/**
 * JPA entity for LinkedIn OAuth 2.0 authentication provider integration.
 * <p>
 * This entity stores LinkedIn user profile data retrieved during the OAuth 2.0 authentication flow,
 * enabling professional network social login via LinkedIn. It links a LinkedIn identity to an OpenKoda
 * User account through a one-to-one shared primary key relationship.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The entity is persisted to the 'linkedin_users' table and uses the {@code @MapsId} pattern to share
 * the primary key with the {@link User} entity, ensuring a strict one-to-one association. Profile fields
 * are synchronized from LinkedIn API v2 responses during authentication, including first name, last name,
 * email (requires r_emailaddress scope), and profile picture URL.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The {@code @DynamicUpdate} annotation optimizes database operations by updating only modified columns
 * rather than all columns, improving performance for partial entity updates.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Example usage:
 * <pre>
 * LinkedinUser linkedinUser = new LinkedinUser(linkedinId, firstName, lastName, email, pictureUrl);
 * </pre>
