/**
 * Concrete Role subclass representing tenant-scoped roles with privileges limited to specific organization context.
 * <p>
 * Persisted to 'roles' table with discriminator value 'ORG'. Extends abstract {@link Role} class via single-table
 * inheritance. Organization roles grant permissions within single tenant boundaries. Privileges are evaluated only
 * within the organization context where user has role assignment via {@link UserRole}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Examples: Organization Admin, Org Member, Org Viewer. Most common role type for multi-tenant applications enforcing
 * data isolation between customers.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Inheritance:</b> Part of Role single-table inheritance hierarchy. {@code @DiscriminatorValue('ORG')} identifies
 * records as organization roles.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Multi-tenancy:</b> Enforces tenant isolation. Users with organization roles can only access data within their
 * assigned organizations. Authorization checks require organizationId matching.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Use cases:</b> Tenant administrators, department managers, organizational viewers, per-customer role customization.
 * </p>
