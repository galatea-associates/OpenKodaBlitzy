/**
 * Concrete Role subclass representing hybrid roles combining both system-wide and tenant-scoped privileges for cross-organizational support scenarios.
 * <p>
 * Persisted to 'roles' table with discriminator value 'GLOBAL_ORG'. Extends abstract Role class via single-table inheritance.
 * Hybrid role type granting both global platform access and organization-specific permissions. Enables support staff or 
 * cross-tenant administrators to access system-wide functions while also operating within organizational contexts. 
 * Examples: Support Engineer with org access, Multi-tenant Account Manager. Less common than pure GlobalRole or OrganizationRole.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Inheritance:</b> Part of Role single-table inheritance hierarchy. @DiscriminatorValue('GLOBAL_ORG') identifies records 
 * as global-organization hybrid roles.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Authorization:</b> Privileges evaluated in both global context (no org requirement) and organizational context (with org ID). 
 * Dual-scope access pattern.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Use cases:</b> Customer support with system access, managed service providers, cross-organizational coordinators, 
 * platform support teams.
 * </p>
