/**
 * JPA mapped superclass that combines {@link TimestampedEntity} with file attachment capabilities.
 * <p>
 * This abstract base class provides reusable file attachment mappings for concrete entities through
 * a dual persistence strategy: full {@link File} entity objects and lightweight {@link Long} IDs.
 * Both representations are persisted to the shared {@code file_reference} join table with an
 * {@code organization_related_entity_id} foreign key and {@code file_id} column.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The dual persistence approach serves different use cases:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code files} - Full {@link File} entity objects mapped via {@code @ManyToMany}, suitable
 *       for accessing complete file metadata and content streams. Marked {@code @JsonIgnore} to
 *       prevent JSON serialization. Uses {@code fetch=LAZY} for performance optimization.</li>
 *   <li>{@code filesId} - Lightweight {@link Long} ID collection mapped via {@code @ElementCollection},
 *       suitable for existence checks and lightweight persistence operations. Initialized to empty
 *       {@link ArrayList} to avoid null checks.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Both collections maintain attachment order via {@code @OrderColumn(name="sequence")}, ensuring
 * files are retrieved in the sequence they were attached. The {@code files} field uses
 * {@code cascade={}} to prevent unintended file deletions when the parent entity is removed.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <strong>Important persistence semantics:</strong>
 * The {@code files} field may be {@code null} outside JPA-managed contexts or when not yet loaded,
 * while {@code filesId} is always initialized to an empty list. The join column is marked
 * {@code insertable=false, updatable=false} indicating non-owning side semantics.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Concrete entities extending this class inherit auditing fields from {@link TimestampedEntity}
 * (createdOn, updatedOn) and file attachment capabilities from {@link EntityWithFiles}.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <strong>Example usage:</strong>
 * <pre>{@code
 * public class Document extends TimestampedEntityWithFiles {
 *     // Document-specific fields
 * }
 * }</pre>
 * </p>
