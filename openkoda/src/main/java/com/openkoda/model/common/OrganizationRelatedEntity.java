/**
 * Defines the contract for domain entities that are scoped to a specific organization (tenant) in the multi-tenant architecture.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This interface establishes the organization-scoped entity pattern used throughout OpenKoda for tenant data isolation.
 * Entities implementing this interface belong to a specific tenant (organization) and are automatically filtered by
 * organization context in queries. This pattern enables secure multi-tenancy where each organization's data is
 * logically separated from other tenants' data.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Primary Use Case:</b> All domain entities that represent tenant-specific data should implement this interface.
 * The organizationId property serves as the tenant discriminator, ensuring that data access operations are
 * automatically scoped to the current user's organization context.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Inheritance Hierarchy:</b>
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Extends {@link OrganizationRelatedObject} - Provides DTO contract for organization association</li>
 *   <li>Extends {@link LongIdEntity} - Provides Long-based primary key contract</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Typical Implementation:</b> Most domain entities extend {@link OpenkodaEntity} which provides the base
 * implementation of this interface, including the organizationId field mapped as a foreign key to the
 * Organization table. The organizationId should be immutable once set (using {@code updatable=false}).
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Tenant Isolation Pattern:</b> The {@link com.openkoda.core.repository.common.SecureRepository} pattern
 * automatically enforces organization-scoped queries, filtering results based on the current user's organization
 * context. This ensures that users can only access data belonging to their organization.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Non-Organization-Related Entities:</b> The following entities are global (cross-tenant) and do NOT implement
 * this interface: User, Token, Role, ReadNotification, FacebookUser, GoogleUser, LDAPUser, LoginAndPassword.
 * These entities are shared across organizations or manage cross-tenant concerns.

     * non-updatable, as it's derived from other entity properties.
