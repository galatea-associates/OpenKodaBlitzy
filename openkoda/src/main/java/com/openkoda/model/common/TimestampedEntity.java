/**
 * Abstract base entity providing automatic audit timestamp functionality for all subclasses.
 * <p>
 * This class serves as a mapped superclass that enables automatic tracking of entity creation
 * and modification information using Spring Data JPA auditing. Entities extending this class
 * automatically receive four audit fields that are populated by the framework without requiring
 * manual intervention.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The class uses {@code @MappedSuperclass} with {@code TABLE_PER_CLASS} inheritance strategy,
 * meaning that subclasses create their own database tables containing all inherited fields.
 * The {@code @EntityListeners(AuditingEntityListener.class)} annotation enables Spring Data JPA
 * auditing to automatically populate the audit fields during entity lifecycle events.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Audit Fields:</b>
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@code createdBy} - Embeddable UID containing the user name/email and ID who created the entity.
 * Populated automatically via {@code @CreatedBy} annotation.</li>
 * <li>{@code createdOn} - LocalDateTime timestamp when the entity was created.
 * Database default is CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, marked as non-insertable and non-updatable.
 * Populated automatically via {@code @CreatedDate} annotation.</li>
 * <li>{@code modifiedBy} - Embeddable UID containing the user name/email and ID who last modified the entity.
 * Populated automatically via {@code @LastModifiedBy} annotation.</li>
 * <li>{@code updatedOn} - LocalDateTime timestamp when the entity was last modified.
 * Updated automatically via {@code @LastModifiedDate} annotation and {@code @PostUpdate} lifecycle callback.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * All timestamp fields use {@code TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE} column definition to ensure proper
 * timezone handling across different database instances. The database manages default timestamps
 * via {@code CURRENT_TIMESTAMP}, with columns configured as non-insertable to delegate timestamp
 * generation to the database layer.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Subclasses must implement the abstract {@code getId()} method to return their entity identifier,
 * which is used by the default {@code toString()} implementation.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Example usage:
 * <pre>{@code
 * @Entity
 * public class Organization extends TimestampedEntity {
 *     @Id private Long id;
 *     public Long getId() { return id; }
 * }
 * }</pre>
 * </p>
