/**
 * Runtime type-level annotation marking JPA entity classes as tenant-scoped for multi-tenancy metadata discovery.
 * <p>
 * This annotation identifies entity tables that participate in OpenKoda's organization-based multi-tenancy model,
 * where data is isolated by organization (tenant). The multi-tenancy infrastructure uses reflection to discover
 * annotated entities and apply tenant-scoping logic, including query filtering, partitioning, and cascade operations.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Entities marked with {@code @TenantedTable} should implement {@link OrganizationRelatedEntity} and include an
 * {@code organizationId} foreign key column referencing the {@link Organization} entity. The {@link SecureRepository}
 * layer enforces tenant-scoped queries automatically, filtering data by the current user's organization memberships.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Example usage:
 * <pre>{@code
 * @Entity
 * @TenantedTable(value = {"form"})
 * public class Form extends OpenkodaEntity implements OrganizationRelatedEntity {
 *     // Entity with tenant isolation via organizationId
 * }
 * }</pre>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The multi-tenancy infrastructure processes {@code @TenantedTable} annotations for:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Schema validation: verify {@code organization_id} column exists</li>
 *   <li>Database partitioning: configure table partitioning by organization for performance and isolation</li>
 *   <li>Data export/import: identify tenant-scoped entities requiring organization context</li>
 *   <li>Organization deletion: cascade delete tenant-scoped data via procedures like {@code remove_organizations_by_id.sql}</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>

     * This array defines table names, partition keys, or tenant identifiers used by the multi-tenancy infrastructure
     * to discover and configure organization-scoped entities. Typical values include:
     * </p>
     * <ul>
     *   <li>Primary table name: {@code @TenantedTable(value = {"user_data"})} - single table tenant scope</li>
     *   <li>Multiple related tables: {@code @TenantedTable(value = {"orders", "order_items"})} - composite tenant scope</li>
     *   <li>Partition configuration: {@code @TenantedTable(value = {"organization_id"})} - partition column identifier</li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * The tenancy discovery mechanism scans the classpath for {@code @TenantedTable} annotations and uses the returned
     * values to identify tables requiring an {@code organization_id} foreign key. This metadata drives partitioning logic
     * for multi-tenant database deployments and ensures tenant data isolation through query filtering.
     * </p>
     *
     * @return array of strings for tenant-scoping configuration (table names, partition keys, or tenant identifiers)
