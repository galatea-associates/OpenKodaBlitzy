/**
 * Contract for entities that support audit trail generation.
 * <p>
 * Entities implementing this interface can generate audit trail strings that are persisted
 * in the {@link Audit} entity when changes occur. This interface extends {@link LongIdEntity}
 * to provide {@code getId()} for entity identification during auditing.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The auditing subsystem, implemented by {@link com.openkoda.core.audit.AuditInterceptor},
 * invokes {@link #toAuditString()} on entity changes during Hibernate session flush operations.
 * The generated audit string is stored in {@code Audit.change} (varchar 16380) or
 * {@code Audit.content} (TEXT) fields depending on property configuration.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Typical implementers include {@link OpenkodaEntity} and concrete entity classes that require
 * change tracking. Implementations should provide concise, human-readable descriptions including
 * entity type and key identifying information.
 * </p>
