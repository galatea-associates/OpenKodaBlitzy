/**
 * Tracks read status for notifications, acting as a many-to-many join entity between {@link User} and {@link Notification}.
 * <p>
 * This entity represents the read status tracking for notifications in a multi-tenant environment.
 * Each ReadNotification record indicates that a specific user has marked a specific notification as read.
 * The unique constraint on (user_id, notification_id) enforces idempotency, preventing duplicate read markers.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * JPA Mapping Details:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Table: {@code read_notification}</li>
 *   <li>Primary Key: {@code id} generated via ORGANIZATION_RELATED_ID_GENERATOR sequence</li>
 *   <li>Unique Constraint: {@code (user_id, notification_id)} for idempotent mark-as-read operations</li>
 *   <li>Foreign Keys: {@code user_id} references users table, {@code notification_id} references notification table</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Extends {@link TimestampedEntity} to automatically track creation and update timestamps.
 * The entity enforces immutability on foreign key columns through {@code insertable=false} and
 * {@code updatable=false} mappings on association fields, with raw FK columns being authoritative.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Operational Usage:
 * Services create ReadNotification instances when users mark notifications as read. The unique constraint
 * ensures that multiple mark-as-read operations are idempotent. No setters exist for FK columns to
 * reinforce immutability and data integrity.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Example usage:
 * <pre>{@code
 * ReadNotification readNotif = new ReadNotification(userId, notificationId);
 * readNotificationRepository.save(readNotif);
 * }</pre>
 * </p>
