/**
 * Canonical enumeration of all system privileges defining fine-grained access control permissions across OpenKoda platform.
 * <p>
 * Defines the complete privilege vocabulary for role-based access control (RBAC). Each enum constant represents a distinct 
 * permission with unique ID (multiplied by idOffset for privilege value range), PrivilegeGroup categorization for UI grouping, 
 * display label, and visibility flag. Implements PrivilegeBase interface for uniform privilege handling and PrivilegeNames for 
 * string constant validation. Privilege IDs are used as database foreign keys in privilege assignment tables. Startup validation 
 * via checkName() ensures enum constant names match PrivilegeNames string constants to prevent configuration drift.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Privilege categories: Organized into PrivilegeGroups: GLOBAL_SETTINGS (system-wide), ORGANIZATION (tenant data), 
 * USER/USER_ROLE (user management), SUPPORT (logs/diagnostics), FRONTEND_RESOURCE (UI resources), TOKEN (authentication), 
 * BACKEND (configuration), HISTORY (audit trails).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * ID allocation: Each privilege ID = enumOrdinalId * idOffset (1), creating unique database values. 
 * Example: isUser (id=1), canAccessGlobalSettings (id=2)
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Hidden privileges: Some privileges marked hidden=true (e.g., canRecoverPassword, canVerifyAccount) are internal-only 
 * and not exposed in UI privilege management screens.
 * </p>
