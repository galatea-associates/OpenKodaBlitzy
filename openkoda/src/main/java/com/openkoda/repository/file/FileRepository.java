/**
 * Spring Data JPA repository managing File entities for document storage and attachments.
 * <p>
 * This repository provides the persistence layer for file upload, download, and attachment handling operations.
 * It extends {@link UnsecuredFunctionalRepositoryWithLongId} to provide standard CRUD operations and
 * implements {@link HasSecurityRules} for security-aware query construction.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The repository includes custom query methods for file lookup by upload UUID, content type filtering,
 * and public file access. It also provides native DELETE queries for deterministic cleanup operations
 * that bypass JPA lifecycle callbacks and auditing.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Usage Pattern:</b> For file deletion, the typical call sequence is {@code removeFileReference}
 * followed by {@code removeFile} to satisfy foreign-key constraints in the file_reference table.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Thread-Safety:</b> Implemented as a thread-safe Spring Data proxy at runtime with proper
 * transaction management through Spring's declarative transactions.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Transaction Requirements:</b> Native DELETE operations must run within transactional boundaries.
 * Callers are responsible for transaction demarcation and persistence context flushing.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * File storage location is configured via FILE_STORAGE_FILESYSTEM_PATH environment variable or
 * application property.
 * </p>
