/**
 * Repositories for managing Organization entities in OpenKoda's multi-tenant architecture.
 * <p>
 * This package provides both secure and unsecured repository interfaces for tenant management,
 * organization hierarchy operations, and properties bag persistence. The repositories enforce
 * tenant boundaries through security-aware JPQL queries and privilege validation.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
 *
 * <h3>Tenant Isolation</h3>
 * <p>
 * Repositories enforce tenant boundaries using security JPQL fragments that filter queries
 * based on user privileges and organization context. This ensures data isolation between
 * different tenants while allowing authorized cross-tenant operations where needed.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>Organization Hierarchy</h3>
 * <p>
 * Supports parent-child organization relationships for modeling enterprise structures.
 * Hierarchical queries enable operations across organization trees while maintaining
 * proper access control at each level.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>Properties Bag Pattern</h3>
 * <p>
 * Organizations use a JSONB properties column for flexible configuration storage. This
 * allows dynamic attributes without schema changes, supporting customization per tenant.
 * Repositories persist and retrieve these properties as Map structures.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>Security Enforcement</h3>
 * <p>
 * The package distinguishes between secure and unsecured operations. Secure repositories
 * apply privilege checks before data access, while unsecured variants support internal
 * system operations that bypass normal authorization rules.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Key Classes</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>OrganizationRepository</b> - Primary Spring Data JPA repository with security-aware
 *       queries for finding organizations by name, ID, or active status. Provides custom
 *       JPQL methods for hierarchical queries and bulk operations.</li>
 *   <li><b>SecureOrganizationRepository</b> - Secure marker interface implementing
 *       SearchableRepositoryMetadata for privilege-checked access. Used by application
 *       controllers and services requiring authorization enforcement.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Integration Points</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>OrganizationService</b> - Business logic layer using these repositories for tenant
 *       provisioning, organization lifecycle management, and schema operations.</li>
 *   <li><b>TenantResolver</b> - Uses organization data to resolve multi-tenancy context from
 *       request parameters, establishing the active organization for the current session.</li>
 *   <li><b>SearchableRepositoryMetadata</b> - Integrates with the indexing subsystem to enable
 *       full-text search across organization names and properties.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Usage Example</h2>
 * <pre><code>
 * Organization org = organizationRepository.findByName("TenantName");
 * List&lt;Long&gt; activeIds = organizationRepository.findActiveOrganizationIdsAsList();
 * </code></pre>
