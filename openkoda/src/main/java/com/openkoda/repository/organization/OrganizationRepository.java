/**
 * Spring Data JPA repository managing Organization entities for multi-tenant operations with security-aware queries and hierarchical organization support.
 * <p>
 * This repository provides comprehensive data access operations for the {@code Organization} entity, which represents
 * tenants in OpenKoda's multi-tenant architecture. It implements both secured and unsecured query methods to support
 * different access control requirements across the application.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Multi-Tenant Operations:</b> Provides queries for organization/tenant lookup by name, status, parent relationships,
 * and datasource assignments. Organizations can be hierarchically structured with parent-child relationships for
 * organizational hierarchy management.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Security Model:</b> Implements both secured methods (using {@code CHECK_CAN_READ_ORG_DATA_OR_IS_ORG_MEMEBER_JPQL}
 * fragment) and unsecured direct lookup methods. The security fragment from {@code HasSecurityRules} enforces row-level
 * access control, ensuring users can only read/delete organizations where they have appropriate privileges or membership.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Properties Bag Persistence:</b> Persists to 'organizations' table with JSONB properties column for flexible
 * tenant configuration. Each organization can store arbitrary key-value properties for customization.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Datasource Mapping:</b> Provides native PostgreSQL query for organization-to-datasource assignment aggregation,
 * enabling multi-database tenant isolation strategies.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Usage by OrganizationService:</b> Primary repository used by {@code OrganizationService} for tenant provisioning,
 * management, and removal operations.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Example usage:
 * <pre>
 * Organization org = organizationRepository.findByName("TenantCo");
 * Map&lt;Long, Integer&gt; datasourceMap = organizationRepository.findOrganizationToDatasourceIndexMap();
 * </pre>
 * </p>
