/**
 * Lightweight DTO for JPQL SELECT NEW projections carrying notification data with read status.
 * <p>
 * This class serves as a target for JPQL queries that combine notification data with read status
 * information from a LEFT JOIN with ReadNotification. It carries a Notification entity plus an
 * optional read-marker ID to indicate whether the notification has been read.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This is a mutable POJO with no validation or defensive copying. It is intended for in-memory
 * use only and has no persistence mappings. Callers are responsible for the object lifecycle.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Example usage in JPQL:
 * <pre>
 * SELECT NEW NotificationKeeper(n, rn.notificationId)
 * FROM Notification n LEFT JOIN n.readNotifications rn
 * </pre>
 * </p>
