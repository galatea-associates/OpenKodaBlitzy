/**
 * Top-level repository aggregator exposing secure and unsecure repository groups for simplified dependency injection.
 * <p>
 * This class is annotated with {@code @Component("AllRepositories")} for Spring bean registration and provides
 * a legacy dependency injection pattern where a single bean injection point gives access to all repository instances
 * instead of injecting individual repository beans. It exposes two public injected fields: {@code secure} for
 * privilege-enforced operations and {@code unsecure} for direct database access bypassing privilege checks.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This aggregator is used throughout controllers and services that need access to multiple repositories. Modern code
 * should prefer injecting specific repository interfaces directly instead of using this aggregator, as it provides
 * better type safety and clearer dependency declarations. However, removing this class would break many injection
 * sites in legacy code paths that rely on the convenience of dot-notation access pattern.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Example usage:
 * <pre>{@code
 * @Autowired Repositories repositories;
 * repositories.secure.organization.findOne(id);
 * }</pre>
 * </p>
 *
 * @author OpenKoda Team
 * @version 1.7.1
