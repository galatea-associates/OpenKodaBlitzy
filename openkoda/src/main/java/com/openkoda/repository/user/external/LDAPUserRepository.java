/**
 * Repository managing LDAPUser entities for LDAP/Active Directory integration.
 * <p>
 * Provides CRUD operations and privilege-protected queries for LDAP-backed user mappings.
 * This repository handles the persistence layer for users authenticated via LDAP directory
 * servers, enabling integration with corporate directory services such as Active Directory,
 * OpenLDAP, or other LDAP-compliant systems.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Authentication Flow:</b><br>
 * LDAP directory server authentication → uid lookup → findByUid → link/create User entity
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Persistence:</b><br>
 * Persists to {@code ldap_user} table in the database, mapping LDAP directory entries
 * to local user entities.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Security:</b><br>
 * Method-level {@code @PreAuthorize} annotations enforce {@code CHECK_CAN_READ_LDAP_USER}
 * privilege via Spring Security. Access to LDAP user data requires appropriate privileges.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Usage Context:</b><br>
 * Used by LDAP authentication provider for directory-based authentication and user management.
 * The repository is typically injected into authentication services that handle LDAP login flows.
