/**
 * Repository managing LinkedinUser entities for LinkedIn Sign-In integration.
 * <p>
 * Provides CRUD operations and privilege-protected queries for LinkedIn OAuth user mappings.
 * This repository handles the persistence layer for LinkedIn authentication, enabling the OAuth flow
 * where external LinkedIn authentication leads to token exchange, user lookup, and User entity linking.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Persists to 'linkedin_user' table with method-level {@code @PreAuthorize} privilege enforcement
 * via Spring Security. The CHECK_CAN_READ_LINKEDIN_USER privilege is required for query operations.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Usage context: Used by LinkedIn OAuth callback controllers for account linking, authentication,
 * and admin flows. Extends Spring Data JPA repository for automatic query generation.
