/**
 * Privilege-enforcing repository aggregator exposing SecureRepository instances for access-controlled data operations.
 * <p>
 * This component aggregates 14 SecureRepository field instances that apply privilege enforcement on all data access operations.
 * All repositories apply USER security scope by default, validating that the current user possesses required read or write
 * privileges before executing queries or modifications. Operations throw {@code AccessDeniedException} if the user lacks
 * the necessary privileges as defined by entity {@code @Formula} annotations (requiredReadPrivilege, requiredWritePrivilege).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The class is annotated with {@code @Component("SecureRepositories")} for Spring bean registration and uses field injection
 * to aggregate repository instances. Each repository field wraps a corresponding domain repository with the SecureRepository
 * interface, providing privilege-checked alternatives to standard Spring Data JPA repository operations.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Typical usage pattern:
 * <pre>{@code
 * repositories.secure.user.findOne(userId); // finds user only if current user has read privilege
 * repositories.secure.organization.save(org); // saves only if current user has write privilege
 * }</pre>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Access this aggregator via the {@code Repositories.secure} field for privilege-checked entity access throughout the application.
 * Privilege requirements are computed from entity annotations and enforced at the repository layer, providing a centralized
 * access control mechanism that integrates with OpenKoda's Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system.
 * </p>
