![openkoda admin](https://github.com/openkoda/.github/assets/14223954/9acded2e-a3e6-4480-805e-7ac38ebdafc0)

## Quick Start

The fastest way to start using Openkoda is to run the system with Docker Compose scripts and a Docker image that contains all the necessary prerequisites: Java, PostgreSQL, and Openkoda.

Make sure Docker Compose is installed on your system.

To download and start the complete system image, simply run this command in your terminal:
```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openkoda/openkoda/main/docker/docker-compose.yaml | docker compose -f - up
```

Once the startup is complete, you can access the Openkoda web application at the following local URL:
```
https://localhost:8080
```
Log in as an Administrator using the default credentials: **login: admin** and **password: admin123**.

### Importing Openkoda application template

You may find some existing sample application templates in the [examples](https://github.com/openkoda/openkoda/tree/main/examples) directory in this repository.

Download the selected application package (as a .zip archive), then import the application within the Openkoda web interface by selecting: **Configuration > Import/Export** from the menu.

**Note:** If the only message you see after starting the import process is "IMPORT FILE," it may indicate that no components were found in the uploaded package, or the .zip file is corrupted or empty. Double-check that the file is not empty on your local filesystem before uploading.



## Installation 


### Installation options

There are two installation options to start application development with Openkoda:
* Running as a Docker container
* Building from sources


### Option #1: Run as a Docker Container

Docker images are available at Docker Hub : https://hub.docker.com/r/openkoda/openkoda

Download the latest version of the Openkoda Docker image from Docker Hub:
```
docker pull openkoda/openkoda:latest
```

Please note that in that case Postgres needs to be already in place and `SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL`, `SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME`, `SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD` env variables need to be adjusted when running docker ([see Docker Hub for detailed options](https://hub.docker.com/r/openkoda/openkoda))

#### Docker compose

A simpler option may be to use the Docker Compose scripts located in the: `./docker/docker-compose.yaml` and `./docker/docker-compose-no-db.yaml` - depending on your preference, with or without Postgres as a part of the docker service. Here is a useful one-liner :
```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openkoda/openkoda/main/docker/docker-compose.yaml | docker compose -f - up
```

### Option #2: Build from Sources

Prerequisites:

Git, Java 17, Maven 3.8+, PostgreSQL 14+

1. [Create an empty PostgreSQL database](https://github.com/openkoda/openkoda.git)
2. Clone or download this Git repository
3. Build application with maven:
```
mvn -f openkoda/pom.xml clean install spring-boot:repackage -DskipTests
```
4. Initialize the database in a first run:
```
java -Dloader.path=/BOOT-INF/classes -Dspring.profiles.active=openkoda,drop_and_init_database -jar build/openkoda.jar --server.port=<http port>
```
5. Run Openkoda 
```
java -Dloader.path=/BOOT-INF/classes -Dsecure.cookie=false -jar build/openkoda.jar --spring.profiles.active=openkoda --server.port=<http port>
```

Detailed instructions can be found in the [Installation](https://github.com/openkoda/openkoda/blob/main/openkoda/doc/installation.md) manual.

### Running dev/test instance without https

Openkoda uses strict secure cookies setting to increase security.

If you want to run a development/test instance of Openkoda without https and not using localhost then you need to disable secure cookies setting by:

* Set the SECURE_COOKIE environment variable to false before starting docker compose, eg. SET SECURE_COOKIE=false (windows), SECURE_COOKIE=false (linux)
* You may need to delete your locally cached Openkoda docker images with docker rmi
* Then proceed as described here: https://github.com/openkoda/openkoda?tab=readme-ov-file#docker-compose


### Resolving installation issues

If you encounter any issues during the installation or when running Openkoda for the first time, please:

* Review the existing GitHub tickets, as a similar problem may have been reported before.
* If not, raise a new ticket, including steps to reproduce the issue and relevant logs—our development team regularly reviews reported issues.

```bash
mvn test -Dtest=OrganizationServiceTest
```

**Skip tests during build:**
```bash
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```

### Test Types

* **Unit Tests** - Test individual components in isolation
* **Integration Tests** - Test component interactions and database operations
* **Selenium Tests** - Automated UI testing for web interfaces
* **Cucumber Tests** - Behavior-driven development (BDD) tests

### Test Structure

Tests are located in `openkoda/src/test/java/` and follow the package structure of source code.

Example test execution:
```bash
# Run Cucumber tests
mvn test -Dtest=CucumberTest

# Run Selenium UI tests
./scripts/ok-test-cucumber.sh
```

### Test Coverage

OpenKoda maintains high test coverage across:
* Core business logic services
* Repository operations and queries
* Controller request/response handling
* Security and authentication flows
* Multi-tenancy operations

### Writing Tests

Extend `AbstractTest` base class for integration tests:

```java
@SpringBootTest
public class MyServiceTest extends AbstractTest {
    @Autowired
    private MyService service;
    
    @Test
    public void testOperation() {
        // Test implementation
    }
}
```

## Monitoring and Logging

### Application Health Monitoring

OpenKoda provides health check endpoints for monitoring application status:

**Health Check Endpoint:**
```bash
curl https://localhost:8080/ping
```

### Spring Boot Actuator

Enable actuator endpoints in `application.properties`:
```properties
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=health,info,metrics
management.endpoint.health.show-details=always
```

Access monitoring endpoints:
* `/actuator/health` - Application health status
* `/actuator/info` - Application information
* `/actuator/metrics` - Performance metrics

### Logging Configuration

OpenKoda uses Logback for logging. Configure log levels in `application.properties`:

```properties
# Root logging level
logging.level.root=INFO

# OpenKoda package logging
logging.level.com.openkoda=DEBUG

# SQL logging
logging.level.org.hibernate.SQL=DEBUG
```

### Log Files

Logs are written to:
* Console output (stdout/stderr)
* Application log files (configurable location)
* System logs accessible via admin dashboard

### Request Tracing

OpenKoda includes request correlation IDs for distributed tracing. Each request receives a unique trace ID visible in logs for debugging.

### System Logs Dashboard

Access system logs through the admin interface:
**Configuration > System > System Logs**

### Monitoring Best Practices

* Enable health checks for load balancers
* Set up log aggregation (ELK stack, Splunk)
* Monitor JVM metrics (heap usage, GC)
* Track database connection pool metrics
* Set up alerts for error rates and response times

## Security

OpenKoda implements enterprise-grade security features to protect applications and data.

### Authentication

**Supported Authentication Methods:**
* Username and password authentication
* OAuth 2.0 integration (Google, Facebook, GitHub)
* LDAP authentication (Enterprise edition)
* API key authentication for REST APIs
* Token-based authentication

**Default Credentials:**
* Username: `admin`
* Password: `admin123`

> **Important:** Change default credentials immediately after first login.

### Authorization

**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**

OpenKoda uses a sophisticated privilege-based security model:

* **Global Roles** - System-wide permissions
* **Organization Roles** - Organization-specific permissions
* **Custom Privileges** - Define custom access rights from UI
* **Attribute-Level Security** - Control access to individual entity fields

### Security Features

* **Secure Cookies** - HTTPS-only cookies in production
* **CSRF Protection** - Built-in cross-site request forgery protection
* **SQL Injection Prevention** - Parameterized queries via JPA
* **XSS Protection** - Template engine auto-escaping
* **Secure Password Storage** - BCrypt password hashing
* **Session Management** - Configurable session timeout
* **Audit Trail** - Complete audit log of all user actions

### Privilege Management

Define and manage privileges:
1. Navigate to **Configuration > Security > Privileges**
2. Create custom privileges
3. Assign privileges to roles
4. Apply roles to users globally or per organization

### SecureRepository Pattern

Data access automatically enforces privilege checks:

```java
SecureRepository<Organization> repo = secureRepositories.organization;
Optional<Organization> org = repo.findOne(id); // Privilege-checked
```

### Security Best Practices

* Enable HTTPS in production environments
* Use strong passwords and enforce password policies
* Regularly review user privileges and roles
* Enable audit logging for compliance
* Keep dependencies updated for security patches
* Configure SECURE_COOKIE=true for production
* Implement network-level security (firewalls, VPNs)
* Regular security audits and penetration testing

For detailed security configuration, see [Admin Documentation](openkoda/doc/admin.md).
